Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read the article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This **Part Four** of the series on Endometriosis. **(tag to TOC)**

<h2>What are the Treatment options?</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote">There is an urgent need to rethink endometriosis care in order to provide a more comprehensive, patient-focused approach with long-term goals.

Currently there is no cure or preventative treatment for endometriosis. There are several treatment options available that can help in disease management. However, few options actually target the disease and most only address the symptoms. Each treatment has its own benefits, limitations, and risks to consider. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contemporary treatments</a> are based upon the surgical removal of lesions and medical strategies that suppress estrogen or menses. Due to the complexity of endometriosis and its symptoms, these strategies do not provide a suitable model of care for patients long term. While there have been efforts to define guidelines by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">various associations</a>, the best treatments for endometriosis still remain controversial and under debate. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The current system’s inability to adequately address endometriosis pain symptoms often results in the emergence of broader functional sequela and psychological impact. The ability to address these broader impacts is crucial and certainly requires a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care. 

<cite><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Sanjay Agarwal, MD, FACOG</a></cite>

Specialists do agree that <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach</a> to care is necessary to address the many comorbidities and complexities of the disease. A multidisciplinary approach often means seeking out a variety of doctors and specialties to widen the scope of your care. A gynecologist will perform the diagnostic surgery and surgical treatment and provide referrals to other healthcare providers.  Combining treatments, such as excision surgery, diet and nutrition, alternative therapies, and physical therapy, can lead to patients effectively managing the disease and their symptoms long term. Patients will also need a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly individualized patient-focused approach</a> to care since no two patients have the same presentation of symptoms. It’s also important that the specialists communicate effectively with one another to bridge the gaps in their knowledge.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Patients with endometriosis often require individualized care over a long-term period, where priorities may change depending upon the type and severity of symptoms, the impact of these symptoms, current or future fertility goals and lifestyle factors. Individualized care benefits from a multi-disciplinary network of experts sufficiently skilled in providing advice on and treatment of endometriosis and its associated symptoms, based on the best available knowledge, their extensive experience, and their transparent record of success rates.

Receiving long term care from a variety of specialists can become extremely costly making it inaccessible for many patients. Due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an antiquated approach</a> to managing complex chronic diseases, insurance policies do not cover complementary treatments and often healthcare providers do not offer them.

<blockquote class="blockquote"> This (single-provider) model of care for a complex chronic disease without a cure can pose challenges for both patients and care providers. With limited complementary strategies, such as mental health, acupuncture, nutrition, and pelvic physical therapy expertise to comprehensively address the patient’s pain and its consequences, optimal care may not be achieved.

<cite><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Sanjay Agarwal,  MD, FACOG</a></cite>

</blockquote>

 For US patients,  ACOG, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, defines the standard of care for endometriosis and ultimately influences what treatments insurance companies will cover. Despite recent data points, patient outcry, and a pushback from specialists, <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2018/11/08/too-often-quality-of-life-for-endometriosis-patients-is-dictated-by-their-financial-resources/?fbclid=IwAR3QhTFx0Gt56Q2ZqS_PJTGm7KuHUpVOyLjojMJXhecodYFhanHB5RFmjaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACOG’s guidelines </a> remain ineffective and outdated and include palliative hormonal medications and ineffective surgeries such as hysterectomies. If ACOG were to recognize excision surgery and the multidisciplinary care approach, insurance companies would be compelled to provide coverage for treatments. 

<blockquote class="blockquote"> The care patients can get varies massively around the world and within countries, and is often dependent on what they can afford. In the US, insurance companies pay the same amount for any endometriosis surgery, regardless of the method or extent of the disease or the specialization of the doctor.<cite><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/28/endometriosis-hidden-suffering-millions-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Sarah Boseley, The Guardian </a></cite>

</blockquote>

All over the world, patients quality of care is often defined by what they can afford. Unfortunately, the bulk of the burden falls on the patient to pursue these services and to pay for them out of pocket. This can delay care and/or make it completely impossible to receive treatment. Without adequate treatment the disease will progress and likely become more debilitating over time. The burden of cost is two fold for an endometriosis patient: the cost of medical treatments and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cost of lost productivity</a>. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The economic burden associated with endometriosis treated in referral centers is high and is similar to other chronic diseases (diabetes, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis). It arises predominantly from productivity loss and is predicted by decreased quality of life.<cite><a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/5/1292/700268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Steven Simoens, MSc, PhD</a></cite>

</blockquote>

Clearly the hurdles to care for endometriosis are multidimensional and require an immense amount of resources, dedicated time, and access to medical care. For patients already burdened with illness, navigating a broken healthcare system, and receiving inadequate care only further <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15154905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detracts from their quality of life</a>. 

As a patient, being informed on the available treatments can help you advocate for your health needs and select the most appropriate options. Unfortunately, the onus is on the patient to become informed and educate the medical community. The following sections will provide a detailed look at many of the available treatments for endometriosis. 

* Surgery: Excision vs Ablation 
* Hormonal Therapy
* Alternative Therapies
* Pain Management

<h3>Surgery</h3>

It's important to note that surgery with confirmation of biopsy specimens is the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only definitive diagnostic tool</a> for confirming endometriosis. Laparoscopy surgery is the most common diagnostic surgery and is also considered a <a href="https://womenssurgerycentertn.com/122/endometriosis-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cornerstone of treatment</a> for the disease. Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which the endometriosis lesions are removed. 

During laparoscopy, the surgical options of removal include excision and superficial treatments such as fulguration, diathermy, vaporization, cautery, etc. Laparoscopic Excision, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAPEX</a>, is defined by the full removal of the entire lesion where it is found. Superficial treatments are as they sound and only target the lesion's surface.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Endometriosis acts like an iceberg.  Despite the disease being identified above the surface of the tissue, the majority is implanted into the tissue below the surface. This is why it is so important to find a surgeon who removes lesions in their entirety.

<cite><a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-The Endometriosis Foundation of America</cite>

</blockquote>

Since endometriosis lesions are often <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deeply imbedded</a> in the surrounding tissue, a thorough approach, like excision, is needed for complete removal. During excision surgery, the lesions are excised or cut out and the tissue underneath is evaluated for abnormal tissue and removed if necessary.  

<blockquote class="blockquote">Laparoscopic Excision (LAPEX) is the surgical cornerstone of any high quality, multidisciplinary approach to correctly treating endometriosis. LAPEX allows for the disease to be meticulously removed, cut out, from all areas, without damaging surrounding structures or removing otherwise healthy organs.

<cite><a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-The Center for Endometriosis Care</cite>

</blockquote>

Studies have found the complete removal of the entire lesion is necessary for symptom relief and successful disease management. LAPEX has been associated with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1833246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> low rate of minimal persistent/recurrent disease</a> and <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptomatic improvements</a> in general health, sexual function, fertility, and quality of life. When performed by an advanced surgeon, the outcomes of excision are far superior to superficial treatments and have a <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-operation rate of 20%</a>. In comparison, the re-operation rate for superficial treatments in 80%.

<blockquote class="blockquote">The high rates of recurrence associated with endometriosis surgery in the literature strongly depend on the completeness of disease removal. LAPEX is a well-established yet under-practiced approach, with the goal at the time of surgery to completely respect all disease, restore normal anatomy, and apply measures for adhesion prevention. Data suggest that the surgical objective should be complete eradication; therefore, the surgeon must be prepared to excise all lesions suggestive of endometriosis as well as all atypical tissue, because in most anatomic sites, approximately 50% of atypical specimens prove to be endometriosis.

<cite><a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Ken R. Sinervo, MD, MSC, FRCSC, ACGE</cite>

</blockquote>

Since lesions are deeply implanted in the surrounding tissue, superficial treatments leave much of the disease untouched and remaining to further progress. This explains the high recurrence of re-operation for superficial methods. <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adhesion formations</a> can also increase substantially due to the presence of residual endometriosis, even in small amounts. The high heat and energy used during surgery can also damage surrounding healthy tissue leading to excess scar tissue.

<blockquote class="blockquote">In most cases, ablation/cauterization surgery will not be effective for long-term management of endometriosis because the tissue remains below the surface. In many cases, the inflammation following ablation and cauterization can be another source of pain. This is why excision surgery is the gold standard for treatment. If a patient is considering surgery, it is important that they ask their surgeon the method for removal.

<cite><a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Endometriosis Foundation of America</cite>

</blockquote>

While the type of surgery ultimately matters, the skill of the surgeon defines the quality of surgery for patients. Unfortunately, a majority of gynecologists are only trained in superficial methods such as cauterization or ablation. Due to the lack of knowledgeable providers,  it's estimated that there are only [100-200 excision surgeons](https://www.endofound.org/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-an-endometriosis-specialist) worldwide for a patient population of 175 million people. Clearly there is a stark lack of support which makes appropriate care even more scarce. Excision is commonly not covered by health insurance and is also one of the most expensive options, making it inaccessible for many patients. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">Who performs the surgery, how and when is of critical importance, however; excision is a highly advanced surgical technique requiring extensive training. Likewise, accuracy in diagnosis and treatment is dependent on the ability of the surgeon to recognize disease in all its different manifestations. This means, if the surgeon is not familiar with all signs of endometriosis...then disease will be missed and left behind untreated; surgeons can only see and treat what they recognize.

<cite><a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Center for Endometriosis Care</cite>

</blockquote>

When considering surgery, LAPEX is considered the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gold standard of care</a>, or the best available option, for endometriosis. The skill and clinical experience of the surgeon is equally important to a patient's outcome and should also be considered before surgery. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">In the medical field, a 'gold standard' treatment for a disease is one that has been proven through validated clinical trials to have the best long-term outcomes and the least complications when compared to other methods of treatment. It simply means that there is no better treatment. In the case of surgical management for treatment of endometriosis, the gold standard is now complete and total surgical excision of any and all visible implants of endometriosis with wide margins around all endometriosis and removal of all underlying scar tissue.

</blockquote>

**Why Hysterectomy is not a treatment option?**

<blockquote class="blockquote">It is a common myth that having a hysterectomy will cure endometriosis. There is no cure for endometriosis and a hysterectomy is rarely the best treatment. Most endometriosis is located in areas other than the reproductive organs. If you simply remove the uterus and do not excise the remaining lesions, the patient will continue to have pain.

<cite><a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Endometriosis Foundation of America</cite>

</blockquote>

Hysterectomy is not a suitable treatment option for endometriosis. Since endometriosis is found outside of the reproductive organs, removing the uterus does not remove the disease. Endometriosis can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127534?fbclid=IwAR1PCTJ0BUkHuiB03sg8QrKMECRCFjofBmpSDSc3ipADCLww5NyuLK2asvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> remain symptomatic</a> after hysterectomy, with or without estrogen therapy. It is recommended that excision be used during castration to remove endometriosis. 

<h3>Hormonal Medications and Oral Contraceptives</h3>

Many doctors use hormonal medications, like oral contraceptives, as a first line option for endometriosis patients. Hormone medication can come in the form of oral contraceptives or birth control pills, progestin only pills, progestin medicines, and GnRH agonists, like Lupron. While hormonal medications are the most commonly prescribed drugs for endometriosis, they have been shown to <a href="http://endopaedia.info/diagnosis12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not eradicate</a>, <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop progression</a>, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve the disease</a>.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Medical therapy represents only a symptomatic treatment and not the definitive solution to endometriosis lesions that may persist despite different medications, dosages, and duration of the therapy

<cite><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2284026519841520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Dr. Federica Di Guardo</cite>

</blockquote>

In theory, hormonal medication is thought to decrease endometriosis tissue activity by halting or suppressing menses. However, there are <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several problems</a> with this approach. Although suppressed, the endometriosis is still <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressing and growing deeper</a>. Since the disease was never removed, the endometriosis tissue will reactivate once suppression stops and <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms will return</a>. <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High recurrence rates</a> of disease are associated with all hormonal medications.

<blockquote class="blockquote">All medical therapy, whether administered as first-line treatment or postoperatively, is associated with high rates of disease recurrence.

<cite><a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Ken R. Sinervo, MD, MSC, FRCSC, ACGE</cite>

</blockquote>

Despite the proven ineffectiveness, many doctors continue to offer hormonal medication as an option for the treatment of endometriosis.  Few are educated on the  <a href="https://drbrighten.com/the-contraception-guide/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Happy+World+Contraception+Day%21&utm_campaign=Happy+World+Contraception+Day%21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risks, side effects, and limitations</a> of hormonal medication and as a result cannot educate their patients accordingly. They often fail to inform patients that it can only provide <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptomatic relief</a>, while the disease will continue to progress and grow deeper. It is important to remember that hormonal medication cannot eradicate the disease,  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot improve fertility</a>, and has shown no effect on adhesions. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">In the general healthcare community including at the OB/GYN level, it is taught (and hence practiced) that the most frequent mainstays of treatment are medical suppressives and incomplete surgery. Medication does not eradicate endometriosis, however, and the disease does not simply ‘go away’ as a result of drug suppression. At best, such a course of therapy provides only a temporary means of symptom improvement, not definitive treatment. Often, side effects are significantly negative and intolerable, and may last far beyond the cessation of treatment. Poor outcomes on suppression therapies are routine: drug therapy that can destroy endometriosis permanently has yet to be discovered. Hormonal suppression has 'no effect on adhesion of endometriotic cells and cannot improve fertility'.

In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent review</a> of hormonal contraceptives for endometriosis related symptoms, certain ones were found to relieve some symptoms, such as pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, and dyspareunia. Due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insufficient evidence</a>, no definitive conclusions could be made about the overall superiority of any particular hormonal contraceptive. However, after a systemic review of the evidence, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supportive data was determined to be of low quality or insufficient</a> to reach conclusions on the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives for treating endometriosis symptoms. Further studies are needed to clarify what place, if any, hormonal contraceptives have in the management of endometriosis.

Another medication commonly used in endometriosis care, is **Lupron**. Lupron is a GnRH antagonist that was originally approved for treatment of advanced male prostate cancer.

Often this will include seeking out a variety of doctors and specialists to address wide reaching symptoms. This can include working with gynecologists, nutritionists, integrative doctors, urologists, and many other types of healthcare providers. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108065/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> has shown several potential benefits to <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(15)00753-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complementary therapies</a> for endometriosis patients.  Examples of complementary therapies include physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and meditation. These <a href="http://www.endometriosis.co.uk/complementary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">therapies</a> include various methods that work on <a href="http://www.endometriosis.co.uk/complementary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mitigating symptoms, stress reduction, and/or disease management</a>. Since all endometriosis patients are different, these methods may not be suitable or successful for everyone.

<blockquote class="blockquote">The majority of patients with chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis have additional related comorbidities.

**Diet and Nutrition** 

Diet and nutrition have become areas of increased interest for potential endometriosis management and prevention. Dietary modification and nutrition  therapy may provide various benefits as a complementary therapy for treating endometriosis. Several studies have shown <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/19/8/1755/2356458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a potential link</a> between endometriosis and diet. It's important to note that more research is needed to truly understand <a href="https://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(13)00007-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the role that diet</a> may play in endometriosis and its symptoms. Based on the available information, several diet recommendations for endometriosis have been developed. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">Dietary modification as a complementary approach and a short-term recourse to reduce the effects of inflammation associated with endometriosis is feasible, practical and can be monitored under physician supervision. Nevertheless, due in part to the complex nature of the condition and the lack of reliable markers to detect disease initiation, scientific-based data are currently deficient to support the ability of anti-inflammatory foods and food components to prevent endometriosis.<cite><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324729920_Diet_and_endometriosis-revisiting_the_linkages_to_inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Sofia Jade U Saguyod</a></cite>

</blockquote>

In other studies, diet has been shown to have a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0884533610385703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modest effect on inflammatory markers</a> that contribute to many modern diseases. Since inflammation contributes to endometriosis and pain symptoms, an <a href="http://obgyn.slu.edu/uploads/centerforendo/Combined%20Anti-Inflammatory%20and%20Elimination%20Diet%20for%20Adults%20Living%20with%20Endometriosis%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-inflammatory diet</a> has been recommended by specialists. An anti-inflammatory diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, plant-based foods, beans, and spices. Foods rich in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324729920_Diet_and_endometriosis-revisiting_the_linkages_to_inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omega-3 fatty acids</a> have shown anti-inflammatory effects that may be beneficial in reducing the chronic inflammation promoted by endometriosis. Fish oil, fatty fish, seeds, and walnuts are examples of Omega-3 rich foods.

On the other hand, diets rich in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873173/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trans fats</a> may increase the risk of endometriosis. Unlike the anti-inflammatory effects of Omega-3 fatty acids, trans fats promote inflammation. Trans fats are found in fast food, processed foods, fried foods, vegetable shortening, and baked goods. A reduction or total removal of trans fats has been suggested for endometriosis patients.

<blockquote class="blockquote">The results of this study suggest that increasing long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake and decreasing trans-unsaturated fatty acid intake may be the first identified modifiable risk factors for endometriosis. In addition, this evidence provides another disease association that supports efforts to remove trans-unsaturated fats from the food supply.

Some researchers believe the origin and progression of endometriosis may be linked to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324729920_Diet_and_endometriosis-revisiting_the_linkages_to_inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diets that are deficient</a> in necessary nutrients. The resulting changes are thought to promote epigenetic abnormalities that could trigger disease. In turn, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may have an ability to protect against or regress endometriosis. <a href="http://obgyn.slu.edu/uploads/centerforendo/Combined%20Anti-Inflammatory%20and%20Elimination%20Diet%20for%20Adults%20Living%20with%20Endometriosis%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organic produce</a> is recommended to reduce your exposure to pesticides which can negatively alter hormonal pathways or decrease the antioxidant capacity of the plants. 

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330594/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red meat consumption</a> and its relationship to endometriosis risk and progression has also been a topic of research. A commonly referenced <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(18)30444-7/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> concluded there was an increased risk of endometriosis associated with a high intake of red meat, such as ham and beef. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254009?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other studies</a> have also resulted in the same association of risk and increased red meat consumption. However, there exists conflicting data from a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875189?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> that showed no association. Red meat is also thought to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330594/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise estrogen</a> which contributes to endometriosis growth. Many specialists recommend a mainly plant based diet. If consuming red meat, <a href="http://obgyn.slu.edu/uploads/centerforendo/Combined%20Anti-Inflammatory%20and%20Elimination%20Diet%20for%20Adults%20Living%20with%20Endometriosis%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">organic, grass fed</a> beef is recommended in small amounts.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Diets deficient in nutrients result in changes in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and promote epigenetic abnormalities, that may be involved in the genesis and progression of the disease. Foods rich in omega 3 with anti-inflammatory effects, supplementation with N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D and resveratrol, in addition to the increased consumption of fruits, vegetables (preferably organic) and whole grains exert a protective effect, reducing the risk of development and possible regression of disease. Dietary re-education seems to be a promising tool in the prevention and treatment of endometriosis.

Estrogen is another point of interest in both disease progression and diet. Estrogen and its effects on disease progression through diet are topics of research. Estrogen stimulates endometriosis growth so some researchers suggest reducing the consumption of foods with an estrogenic effect, or the ability to raise internal estrogen levels. These foods contain <a href="https://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(13)00007-2/fulltext#s0120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phytoestrogens</a> which are plant derived compounds that have an estrogenic effect on the endocrine system. Examples of phytoestrogens include soy, flaxseeds, some grains, and legumes. However, a different <a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2007/05000/Effect_of_Soy_Isoflavones_on_Endometriosis_.19.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that an increased consumption of soybeans was associated with a reduced risk of advanced endometriosis. Researchers theorize that phytoestrogens may actually have the ability to block the effects of estrogen rather than increase it. Due to conflicting data, more research is needed to clarify which approach is beneficial for endometriosis. 

Gluten may play a role in endometriosis symptoms and pain. Several studies have found that following a <a href="https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/gluten-and-endometriosis-is-there-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gluten-free diet</a> can lead to a reduction in symptoms and improvements in quality of life for endometriosis patients. 75 percent of the women who took part in the study reported a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decrease in painful symptoms</a> after following a gluten-free diet for 12 months. A considerable increase in physical functioning, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, and mental health was also observed in all patients. Endometriosis is known to have a variety of comorbidities and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/10/2896/611791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celiacs disease</a> may be one. In research, endometriosis seems to be associated with prior Celiacs Disease. Potential explanations might be shared etiological factors and inflammation from Celiacs Disease. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">Nutritional counseling and therapy alongside orthodox medical treatments provides a cost effective method in the reduction of pain and improvements in the quality of life of patients with endometriosis.

While further research is needed to clarify the role of diet in disease, nutritional counseling and diet change have been shown to be a <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)01944-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost effective method to reduce pain</a> and improve the quality of life of patients with endometriosis. Patients self-report significant responses to dietary choices that can either trigger or relieve their symptoms. Dietary changes were among the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6332532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most highly rated self-management strategies</a> in a survey of endometriosis patients.

Each person with endometriosis has individual needs and food triggers. The Elimination Diet protocol is considered a useful method for identifying personal food triggers and creating an individualized diet plan based on the results.

**Physical Therapy**

Specialists and researchers agree that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complementary strategies, like physical therapy, </a> may help to comprehensively address the patient's pain from endometriosis 

<blockquote class="blockquote">Although future research is needed, this therapy, designed to increase function and reduce pain by restoring soft tissue, visceral and osseous mobility, is a non-pharmaceutical, non-surgical technique that has produced few adverse effects or complications.

Physical therapy to address endometriosis related pain has shown promise in initial studies. In one study, participants experienced significant improvements in all domains of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.5301/JE.2012.9088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual function, including pain, desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction</a>. The specific manual therapy used is thought to deform or cause failure of adhesive crosslink bonds. As a result, pain decreases and visceral and osseous mobility appears to improve. Since few studies have been conducted, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 

The pelvic floor muscles function as a support for the pelvic organs and make up part of the urethra, rectum, and vagina. These muscles allow for sexual intercourse and the normal functioning of bladder, bowel. When the muscles are too relaxed or too tight, it is called <a href="http://centerforendo.com/the-significance-of-pelvic-floor-muscle-dysfunction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, or PFD</a>. PFD is associated with endometriosis, Interstitial Cystitis, and Chronic Pelvic Pain.

Chronic Pelvic Pain and Interstitial Cystitis or painful bladder syndrome are common comorbidities of endometriosis. Studies on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18304280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pelvic floor physical therapy</a> for these two conditions have shown promise. Pelvic floor physical therapy addresses musculoskeletal components that are involved in pelvic and genital pain syndromes and sexual dysfunction. Physical therapy treatments include manual therapy, electrical stimulation modalities, self care education, stress management, and biofeedback. 

 While <a href="http://centerforendo.com/the-significance-of-pelvic-floor-muscle-dysfunction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kegel exercises</a> are commonly suggested for strengthening the pelvic floor, they may not be suitable for patients with PFD. During a kegel, the pelvic floor muscles are contracted. In PFD, the pelvic floor muscles may be hypertonic, or too tense, so this would not be appropriate. The most suitable exercises for your particular case are decided after you have been evaluated by the physical therapist.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Physical therapy treatment of pelvic pain is an integral component of the multidisciplinary approach to Chronic Pelvic Pain and associated sexual dysfunction.

**Acupuncture**

There has been limited research on the efficacy of acupuncture for treating endometriosis related pain. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current literature</a> suggests that acupuncture has the ability to reduce pain and serum CA-125 levels. Higher levels of CA-125 levels have been reported in more advanced degrees of endometriosis. 

A systemic review found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acupuncture</a> can alleviate the pain of dysmenorrhoea and reduce peripheral blood CA-125. As a result, the therapy could be applied as a complementary treatment for endometriosis-related pain. However due to the limitations of the original studies, additional studies are needed to confirms these findings. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">Acupuncture may serve as a complement or alternative to these treatments. The pain-alleviating effects of acupuncture have been attributed to various physiological and psychological processes, such as activation of endogenous descending pain inhibitory systems, deactivation of brain areas that transmit pain-related signals, interaction between nociceptive impulses and somato-visceral reflexes, and the expectation of symptom relief.

**Yoga**

There has been limited research on the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for endometriosis. The available literature reports it has the ability to <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/acm.2015.0343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lower daily pain, reduce levels of chronic pelvic pain, and improve quality of life</a> for those with endometriosis.

Participants of the study reported a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greater knowledge of self, autonomy, and self care</a>. They also reported it was beneficial to control pelvic pain and, in turn they reduced the use of pain and psychiatric medications. Researchers identified bodily and psychosocial mechanisms  that could control pain in patients with endometriosis. For successful pain control,  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mind and body integrative techniques</a> are very important.

Specialists also have recommended <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complementary therapies, like yoga</a> to successfully manage the patient's pain long term.
