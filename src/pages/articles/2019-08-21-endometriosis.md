Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This article and site are dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers. 

# What is Endometriosis? (this is H1, prevent this)

> Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue located outside the womb. These fragments are different structurally, and behave differently, from the normal endometrium which is shed during a period. With endometriosis, the disease commonly occurs on the pelvic structures (and sometimes beyond), causing severe pain, bowel, bladder or other organ dysfunction, inflammation, scarring and adhesions, and in some cases, infertility. Endometriosis represents a significant clinical challenge commonly associated with reduced quality of life in those affected.  Symptoms are frequently wide-ranging and often start early in life, but may be underappreciated by medical and lay communities alike.

> This abnormal tissue contains endometrial glands and stroma. The glands secrete substances that irritate the surrounding tissues, sometimes causing them to bleed. The immune system responds to the release of these substances by releasing inflammatory proteins that rush to the site of disease, causing swelling and inflammation. Over time, scar tissue may form and bands of scarring may develop, sticking the pelvic organs together (adhesions).

> Alterations in certain biological processes of the endocrine and immune systems have also been observed with the disease, and endometriosis is embodied by a complexity of multiple immunologic abnormalities, endocrine alterations and unusual expression of adhesion molecules.

> Thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease is still incomplete. Acquired data revealed metabolic reprogramming of ectopic stromal cells with extensive upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of oxidative respiration, a widespread metabolic phenotype known as the Warburg effect and previously described in many cancers. Our results additionally highlight other molecular changes of ectopic endometriotic stromal cells indicating reduced apoptotic potential, increased cellular invasiveness and adhesiveness, and altered immune function.

> Endometriosis is much more than simple, so-called 'killer cramps,' as it is often mistakenly labeled, with symptoms routinely occurring apart from menses at any time of the cycle and, in many instances, becoming chronic in nature. Not all persons with endometriosis will have all symptoms or comorbidities, of course, and no two cases are identical.

> Endometriosis presents with a number of different symptoms and different appearances, and there is a poor correlation between the extent of the disease and the severity of the symptoms.

> While some patients are relatively symptom-free except for certain times of their cycles (menstruation and ovulation), others are debilitated by pain each and every day of the month. Many patients experience a gradual worsening of symptoms over time, both in severity and in the duration of symptoms i.e., the number of days per month they are affected. A common myth is that endometriosis only affects a patient during their period – while this may be the case for some patients, for most patients the pain affects them both during and outside their period.

## What are the Potential Causes?

> Often called a 'disease of theories,' the definitive cause(s) of endometriosis remain under debate, though demonstrated association with a number of hereditary, environmental, epigenetic and menstrual characteristics exist. _No single researcher has found 'the' answer._ The chronic, inflammatory reaction, infertility and pain associated with endometriosis may also correspond to a variety of co-morbid conditions ranging from autoimmune disease to food and environmental allergies and intolerances. Theories include:
>
> * Retrograde menstruation– Sampson’s century-old theory of abnormal backflow; this does _not_ explain pathogenesis
> * Immunologic dysfunction– a 'broken' immune system allows for implantation of menstrual debris
> * Stem Cells– have been demonstrated to populate lesions, even in absence of menstruation
> * Genetics– a 7-10 fold risk exists in those whose mother or relative has disease
> * Environmental Toxins– can cause cell changes which allow for implantation and errant immune response
>
> No single theory explains endometriosis in all patients, particularly in (cis) males with endometriosis and extrapelvic forms of the disease. Likely, we are born with mechanisms which, when later combined – 'the perfect storm' – trigger the disease.
>
> \-Endometriosis Research Center

Dr. Dan C Martin's paper, [Endometriosis Concepts and Theories](https://www.danmartinmd.com/files/endotheory.pdf), reviews over 200 articles on endometriosis. Dr. Martin found, 

> No concept or theory is entirely adequate. It takes eighteen to introduce what I have seen published and many more to discuss what I have read.

## How is it Diagnosed?

Due to prevailing myths and misinformation, providers are often not knowledgable about which procedure is necessary for diagnosis. According to clinical reports, recent studies, and endo specialists the only way to verify endometriosis is via diagnostic laparoscopy with confirmation of biopsy specimens.

> Although the diagnosis can be strongly suspected by history and physical findings, correct diagnosis requires surgery. Laparoscopy is currently the most common method of surgical diagnosis. 
>
> \-[Dr. David Redwine](http://endopaedia.info/diagnosis12.html)
>
> **Laparoscopy & Pathology Report:** The only way to verify endometriosis is to undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy with pathology confirmation of biopsy specimens.
>
> **Lab testing does not test for endometriosis:** There is no test for endometriosis, meaning patients cannot have their blood, urine, or saliva tested to confirm the disease. Using anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) as a marker for ovarian reserve and fertility, and in turn, a suspicion for endometriosis, is a connection starting to be proposed amongst the scientific community, but more research is certainly needed to see if this could be employed in labs. It is a subject of study as AMH is the primary hormone released during folliculogenesis, which is the making and releasing of follicular cells that go on to be mature eggs in the ovaries. Thus, it is of great interest to reproductive specialists, with a possible connection to endometriosis.
>
> **Imaging testing is helpful but not definitive:** Despite popular opinion, clear evidence of endometriosis is not visible through computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or even ultrasounds.  While imaging tests, pelvic exams, especially rectovaginal exams, can all indicate suspicion of endometriosis, they cannot confirm it. Nevertheless, it is common practice to obtain a pelvic ultrasound and MRI before undergoing laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.
>
> **The big issue at hand:** It takes on average 10 years from symptom onset to receive an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis in the United States. This is due to a lack of knowledge among the general public and medical community. Unfortunately, many endometriosis patients are misdiagnosed, often multiple times, leading to unnecessary and inappropriate treatment. This is why it is so crucial to spread further awareness of the disease and support research and funding.

## What are the Treatment options?

This section provides information on the available endometriosis treatments with special attention paid to the limitations and risks of each method, including surgery and medications. Some of the therapies listed target endometriosis while others work to address the symptoms. Specialist agree that a multidisciplinary approach to care is needed to address the many components and complexities of the disease. Combining treatments may allow patients to effectively manage their symptoms long term.

* Surgery: Excision vs Ablation 
* Hormonal Therapy
* Alternative Therapies
* Pain Management

**Excision Surgery**

> In the medical field, a “gold standard” treatment for a disease is one that has been proven through validated clinical trials to have the best long-term outcomes and the least complications when compared to other methods of treatment. It simply means that there is no better treatment. For decades, it was taught to residents in OB/GYN training that surgical thermal or laser ablation of endometriosis and surgical excision of endometriosis provided similar outcomes. Experts in surgical management of endometriosis have known for years that this is not the case. Finally, we now have data from very good clinical trials that excision surgery for endometriosis is far superior to ablation. In the case of surgical management for treatment of endometriosis, the gold standard is now complete and total surgical excision of any and all visible implants of endometriosis with wide margins around all endometriosis and removal of all underlying scar tissue.
>
> \-[Women’s Surgery & Aesthetics Center](https://womenssurgerycentertn.com/122/endometriosis-surgery) 
>
> Excision has been studied quite extensively, and many different studies from around the world have shown very consistent results. Redwine published his outcomes in 1991 after laparoscopic excision of endometriosis where he followed those patients for up to 7 years postop. About half had no further pain and no reasons for subsequent surgery, and the other half required another surgery for various indications- pain, bleeding, masses, etc. He showed a 57% cure rate in reoperated patients, and a 19% incidence of recurrence or persistence among all patients who underwent excision (this assumes no recurrences in the pain-free patients who didn’t have another surgery). Several other studies showed very similar results. 
>
> [\-Pacific Endometriosis and Pelvic Surgery](https://womenssurgerycentertn.com/122/endometriosis-surgery)
>
> Deep-excision is performed during laparoscopic excision surgery, where the surgeon carefully excises or removes, the entire lesion from wherever it is found. This includes the tissue beneath the surface. Endometriosis acts like an iceberg- despite the disease being identified above the surface of the tissue, the majority is implanted into the tissue below the surface. This is why it is so important to find a surgeon who removes lesions in their entirety.
>
> \-The Endometriosis Foundation of America (EndoFound)
>
> Quality surgery - excision - is the cornerstone of successful treatment for endometriosis. However, it doesn't stop there. Multidisciplinary care is needed to fully address all components of the disease. Most of all, individuals with endometriosis need to be heard.
>
> \-Center for Endometriosis Care

**Other Surgeries**

> Other types of surgery include ablation or cauterization. Both of these only remove the tissue on the surface but neglect the tissue growing beneath the surface. In most cases, ablation/cauterization surgery will not be effective for long-term management of endometriosis because the tissue remains below the surface. Excess scar tissue can also form using these methods due to the high energy and heat applied to surrounding healthy tissue. In many cases, the inflammation following ablation and cauterization can be another source of pain. This is why excision surgery is the gold standard for treatment. If a patient is considering surgery, it is important that they ask their surgeon the method for removal.

**Why Hysterectomy is not a treatment option?**

> It is a common myth that having a hysterectomy will cure endometriosis. There is no cure for endometriosis and a hysterectomy is rarely the best treatment. Most endometriosis is located in areas other than the reproductive organs. If you simply remove the uterus and do not excise the remaining lesions, the patient will continue to have pain. 
>
> \-The Endometriosis Foundation of America (EndoFound)

The article [Endometriosis Persisting after Castration: clinical characteristics and results of surgical management](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127534?fbclid=IwAR1PCTJ0BUkHuiB03sg8QrKMECRCFjofBmpSDSc3ipADCLww5NyuLK2asvA) explains why hysterectomy is _not_ a suitable treatment option.

> Endometriosis can remain symptomatic after castration, with or without estrogen therapy. In such patients, there is a 33% frequency of intestinal involvement. At castration, consideration should be given to removal of invasive peritoneal and intestinal disease. Symptom improvement occurs in most patients after excision of endometriosis.

While surgery is an accepted approach, there are specialists who support non-surgical approaches and I have provided those resources below. 

**Hormonal Contraceptives and Hormone Therapy**

Knowing the true place of hormonal therapy in the treatment of endometriosis is imperative for a patient. Hormone therapy can come in the form of birth control pills, progesterone only pills, progesterone medicines, and GnRH agonists. Most providers will offer or suggest using hormonal suppression as treatment but few are educated on the risks, side effects, and limitations of these options. Many providers will inaccurately present oral contraceptives as a targeted "treatment" to stop the disease growth. Too often they fail to inform us that hormone therapy may only provide symptomatic relief and that the disease will continue to progress.

> In the general healthcare community including at the OB/GYN level, it is taught (and hence practiced) that the most frequent mainstays of treatment are medical suppressives and incomplete surgery. Medication does not eradicate endometriosis, however, and the disease does not simply ‘go away’ as a result of drug suppression. At best, such a course of therapy provides only a temporary means of symptom improvement, not definitive treatment. Often, side effects are significantly negative and intolerable, and may last far beyond the cessation of treatment. Poor outcomes on suppression therapies are routine: drug therapy that can destroy endometriosis permanently has yet to be discovered. Hormonal suppression has 'no effect on adhesion of endometriotic cells and cannot improve fertility', and success of said therapies may be dependent on localization/type of lesions, with superficial peritoneal/ovarian disease responding better than deep/infiltrative disease.

> \-Center for Endometriosis Care

Studies and endo specialists agree hormonal therapies do not treat the disease. At times, they can be used to manage certain symptoms until proper intervention or relief can be attained. An eye opening review and one I mention to all of my doctors is [Hormonal Contraception in Women with Endometriosis: a Systematic Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664383). The authors found, 

> Combined hormonal contraceptives and progestin-only contraceptives are effective for the relief of endometriosis-related dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and dyspareunia, and improve Quality of Life. Some combined oral contraceptives decreased the risk of disease recurrence after conservative surgery, but progestin-only contraceptives did not. There is insufficient evidence, however, to reach definitive conclusions about the overall superiority of any particular hormonal contraceptive.

This means certain hormonal contraceptives work to relieve symptoms but have no impact on the disease progression and should not be used to target endometriosis. Some combined oral contraceptives may decrease the recurrence of disease after surgery, but this does not prove that they provide this effect alone. However, after reviewing 16 trails,  [The Cochrane Library](https://www.cochrane.org/CD003678/MENSTR_there-is-no-evidence-that-hormonal-suppression-either-before-or-after-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-associated-with-a-benefit) found,

> There is no evidence of benefit associated with post surgical medical therapy and insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a benefit from pre-surgical medical therapy with regard to the outcomes evaluated.

The article [Continuous Amenorrhea May Be Insufficient to Stop the Progression of Colorectal Endometriosis](https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract) provides similar insights into the use of hormonal contraception for disease management. It demonstrates the obvious progression of deep rectal endometriosis despite 4 years of continuous hormonal therapy.

To note, hormonal contraceptives can cause intolerable, significantly negative side effects including [stroke](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.020084), [Crohn's Disease](https://gut.bmj.com/content/45/2/165), and certain [cancers](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/06/568836583/even-low-dose-contraceptives-slightly-increase-breast-cancer-risk-study-finds). Side effects can last long after cessation of the medication. For a deeper dive into the benefits and side effects of hormonal contraceptives check out [Dr. Jolene Brighten](https://drbrighten.com/birth-control-what-your-doctor-didnt-tell-you/) and [Dr. Laura Briden](https://www.larabriden.com/the-pill-is-bad-medicine-7-ways-that-hormonal-contraception-harms-women/) who are trusted authorities on hormonal health. Dr. Isabella Wentz's, an expert in thyroid health, covers this topic in her article, [14 Ways Birth Control Pills Rob Us of Our Health. ](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/14-ways-birth-control-pills-rob-us-of-our-health/) For more information, [Endopedia.com](http://endopaedia.info/treatment7.html) discusses specific drugs, effectiveness, and side effects.  

The newest hormonal drug, **Orilissa/Elagolix**, has received largely negative reviews from studies, experts, and patients. For example, [The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review's final report](https://icer-review.org/announcements/elagolix-final-report/) showed limitations in evidence on the long-term safety and effectiveness of Elagolix for Endometriosis.

> While elagolix appears to offer short-term clinical benefits in terms of reduced pain and improved quality of life for women living with endometriosis, evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out the possibility that this therapy may pose long-term safety risks for patients  
>
> \-Dan Ollendorf, PhD, ICER’s Chief Scientific Officer. 

An excerpt from [Elagolix for Endometriosis: all that glitters is not gold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551159) says,

> To date, the efficacy of elagolix has only been demonstrated in placebo-controlled explanatory trials. Pragmatic trials comparing elagolix with low-dose hormonal contraceptives and progestogens should be planned to verify the magnitude of the incremental benefit, if any, of this GnRH antagonist over currently used standard treatments.

Here is a searchable [database](http://www.fdable.com/basic_query/aers/7fa29a3fe647402fb0fdd36d2f64c00d) of FDA Adverse Event Cases for Elagolix. 

**Lupron**, a GnRH antagonist, was originally approved for treatment of advanced male prostate cancer but is now commonly used in endometriosis care. It's creator, Takeda-Abbott Pharmaceuticals (now known as AbbVie), has been found guilty of [fraudulent drug prices](https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2001/October/513civ.htm) and [marketing conduct](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/04/business/2-drug-makers-to-pay-875-million-to-settle-fraud-case.html) and was later reprimanded for not [investigating deaths](https://www.biospace.com/article/abbvie-responds-to-fda-criticism-over-manufacturing-complaints/) in association with several of its drugs, including Lupron. 

Lupron [has a controversial history](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/georgia-woman-says-drug-used-to-treat-endometriosis-led-to-series-of-health-problems/859263892) of significant and long lasting [side effects](https://www.rxlist.com/lupron-side-effects-drug-center.htm#overview). There have been numerous [lawsuits](https://www.lupronvictimshub.com/lawsuits.html) launched by patients who claim the drug is responsible for a wide range of chronic symptoms, including bone loss, memory loss, vision loss, and pain. Patients have filed nearly 24,000 reports for adverse reaction from Lupron to the FDA. [The FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers/potential-signals-serious-risksnew-safety-information-identified-fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-15) deemed more than half of them serious cases and is evaluating it for regulatory actions. Here is a searchable [database](http://www.fdable.com/basic_query/aers/81dd978d5a329b02fb95fcb4bafd485b) of FDA Adverse Event Cases for Lupron. 

**Alternative Therapies**

Endo specialists agree a multidisciplinary approach is needed for disease management and patient success. Often this can include seeking out a variety of doctors and specialties to widen your approach. Alternative therapies can include various methods aimed at mitigating symptoms, stress reduction, and/or disease management. Since all patients are different, these methods may not be suitable or successful for everyone. 

* Physical Therapy
* Diet and Nutrition
* Acupuncture
* Yoga
* Chinese Medicine
* Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy
* Holistic, Integrative Medicine
* Exercise
* Herbal Therapy
* Meditation

**Pain Management**

Since severe and chronic pain can be a debilitating symptom of endometriosis, it's important to find treatment methods that work and ways to cope. Pain management can include a wide range of therapies that the patient can cater to their individual needs. Since no two patient cases are identical, they may have varying success with these methods.

* Yoga
* Acupuncture
* Exercise 
* Massage
* Pain Medication, over the counter and pharmaceuticals
* Herbal Treatments
* Therapy 
* Meditation

## Finding a Specialist

Though endometriosis is a common condition affecting 176 billion people worldwide, there are very few specialists in the medical community. It's estimated that there are only [100-200 excision surgeons](https://www.endofound.org/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-an-endometriosis-specialist) in practice worldwide. What a stark lack of medical support for an epidemic scaled disease. Finding a knowledgable and compassionate provider can be one of the hardest aspects of managing this disease. Without proper medical support, the symptoms can become chronic comorbidities that will need their own medical intervention. Here are some tools for finding a knowledgable provider near you:
