# What is Endometriosis? (this is H1, prevent this)

> Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue _similar_ to the lining inside the uterus (called “the endometrium”), is found _outside_ the uterus, where it induces a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in scar tissue.  It is primarily found on the pelvic peritoneum, on the ovaries, in the recto-vaginal septum, on the bladder, and bowel. **(NOTE: We talked about the block quote having stylized quotation marks with my red color and no indentation. Also, Fix LINKS so they open in a NEW tab.)**

> Endometriosis is a condition where tissue that is _somewhat similar_ to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is found _outside the uterus_ where it does not belong. This abnormal tissue contains endometrial glands and stroma. The glands secrete substances that irritate the surrounding tissues, sometimes causing them to bleed. The immune system responds to the release of these substances by releasing inflammatory proteins that rush to the site of disease, causing swelling and inflammation. The disease itself and the inflammatory response to the disease can cause the patient severe pelvic pain. Over time, scar tissue may form and bands of scarring may develop, sticking the pelvic organs together (adhesions).

> Endometriosis is a prevalent health condition in women of reproductive age characterized by ectopic growth of endometrial-like tissue in the extrauterine environment. Thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease is still incomplete. Acquired data revealed metabolic reprogramming of ectopic stromal cells with extensive upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of oxidative respiration, a widespread metabolic phenotype known as the Warburg effect and previously described in many cancers. Our results additionally highlight other molecular changes of ectopic endometriotic stromal cells indicating reduced apoptotic potential, increased cellular invasiveness and adhesiveness, and altered immune function.

> Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue located outside the womb.  These fragments are different structurally, and behave differently, from the normal endometrium which is shed during a period. With endometriosis, the disease commonly occurs on the pelvic structures (and sometimes beyond), causing severe pain, bowel, bladder or other organ dysfunction, inflammation, scarring and adhesions, and in some cases, infertility. Endometriosis represents a significant clinical challenge commonly associated with reduced quality of life in those affected.  Symptoms are frequently wide-ranging and often start early in life, but may be underappreciated by medical and lay communities alike.

## **What are the symptoms?(H2)**

* Pelvic Pain
* Low Back Pain
* Leg Pain
* Cyclical Pain
* Pain in Bowel and Bladder
* Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction
* Pain with Sex
* Bloating
* Nausea and Vomiting
* Fatigue

> While some patients are relatively symptom-free except for certain times of their cycles (menstruation and ovulation), others are debilitated by pain each and every day of the month. Many women experience a gradual worsening of symptoms over time, both in severity and in the duration of symptoms i.e., the number of days per month they are affected. A common myth is that endometriosis only affects a woman during her period – while this may be the case for some women, for most patients the pain affects them both during and outside their period.

## **Online Resources**:

Here are trusted informational online resources that explain the definition, theorized causes, and treatment options available for the disease. Unfortunately, some of these sources do not use inclusive language and rely on gendered language. I will always use inclusive language on my site, unless I am citing a quote.:

* [Centerforendo.com](http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease) is an endo specialist lead resource for disease definition, symptoms, treatments, and additional resources in their content library
* [The Endometriosis Association](https://endometriosisassn.org/about-endometriosis) is a self-help organization of women and families with endo, doctors, scientists, and others interested in exchanging information about the endometriosis disease.
* [Endometriosis Foundation of America](https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis-a-to-z) is a non profit that strives to increase disease recognition, provide advocacy, facilitate expert surgical training, and fund landmark endometriosis research.
* [Endometriosis News](https://endometriosisnews.com/what-is-endometriosis/) is a science and health publishing website for endometriosis.
* [Endometriosis Research Center](https://www.endocenter.org/do-you-have-endo/) is a non profit and was among the first endometriosis organizations to be formed in the United States. They're addressing the ongoing need for international endometriosis awareness, advocacy, support, education, legislative efforts and research facilitation.

## Books:

These books cover an array of information on the disease so I would suggest choosing the topics most relevant to your case. When possible, read as many as you can to expand your understanding of this complex disease. Use your local library to access these books for free. Libraries often have these titles as physical books or ebooks.

## Causes:

> Often called a “disease of theories,” the definitive cause(s) of endometriosis remain under debate, though demonstrated association with a number of hereditary, environmental, epigenetic and menstrual characteristics exist.  NO SINGLE RESEARCHER HAS FOUND “THE” ANSWER.  The chronic, inflammatory reaction, infertility and pain associated with endometriosis may also correspond to a variety of co-morbid conditions ranging from autoimmune disease to food and environmental allergies and intolerances.

## Diagnostic Options:



## Treatment options:

These article provide information on the available endometriosis treatments with special attention paid to the limitations and risks of each method, including surgery and medications. 

* Excision vs ablation
* Birth control methods/ Side Effects

> In the medical field, a “gold standard” treatment for a disease is one that has been proven through validated clinical trials to have the best long-term outcomes and the least complications when compared to other methods of treatment.  It simply means that there is no better treatment.  For decades, it was taught to residents in OB/GYN training that surgical thermal or laser ablation of endometriosis and surgical excision of endometriosis provided similar outcomes.  Experts in surgical management of endometriosis have known for years that this is not the case.  Finally, we now have data from very good clinical trials that excision surgery for endometriosis is far superior to ablation. In the case of surgical management for treatment of endometriosis, the gold standard is now complete and total surgical excision of any and all visible implants of endometriosis with wide margins around all endometriosis and removal of all underlying scar tissue.

## Finding a Specialist:

Though endometriosis is a common condition affecting 176 billion people worldwide, there are very few specialists in the medical community. It's estimated that there are only 100-200 excision surgeons in practice worldwide. (womenssurgerycenter) What a stark lack of medical support for an epidemic scaled disease. Finding a knowledgable and compassionate provider can be one of the hardest aspects of managing this disease. Without proper medical support, the symptoms can become chronic comorbidities that will need their own medical intervention. Here are some tools for finding a provider near you:

* [Nancy's Nook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/418136991574617/) is a self guided research tool that provides an updated list of excision specialists
* 

## Holistic Natural Approach:

These resources provide insight on dietary and lifestyle changes that can aid in the healing process and a whole body approach when it comes to treatments.

* [Dr. Jolene Brighten](https://drbrighten.com/causes-endometriosis-5-natural-treatment-strategies/) is a Functional Medicine Naturopathic Physician and a women's health expert. I've recommended her book in the above section. Also, check out her social media for daily women's health information. 
* [Dr. Laura Briden](https://www.larabriden.com/endometriosis-treat-the-immune-system/) is a Naturopathic Doctor and women's health activist. I've recommended her book in the above section. 
* [Endo Empowered](https://www.endoempowered.com/) offers a holistic approach with support created by an endo patient and Naturopathic Medicine student, Melissa Turner. 

## Support:

Finding adequate support, receiving validation, and maintaining one's self worth and dignity are all important components of disease management and basic human rights.

* [Endo Warriors](https://endowarriorssupport.com/?fbclid=IwAR1nFdWZH5vaHeyUgLpbqAnUPFLmuMnvetnvcpa5VOnC3zwbFvWmGkyzV6Q) is an organization created by endometriosis patients to provide personalized support patient to patient as well as up to date information on treatment options and care.
