# What is Endometriosis? (this is H1, prevent this)

> Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue _similar_ to the lining inside the uterus (called “the endometrium”), is found _outside_ the uterus, where it induces a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in scar tissue.  It is primarily found on the pelvic peritoneum, on the ovaries, in the recto-vaginal septum, on the bladder, and bowel. **(NOTE: We talked about the block quote having stylized quotation marks with my red color and no indentation.)**

> Endometriosis is a puzzling disease that affects our hormones, our immune system (the system that fights germs and cancer), and the digestive tract (the system involved in the breakdown and absorption of our food).

## **Online Resources (H2)**:

Here are trusted informational online resources that explain the definition, believed causes, and treatment options available for the disease:

* [endo](http://endometriosis.org/)

## Books (H2):

These books cover an array of information on the disease so I would suggest reading as many as you can. Use your local library to access these books for free. Libraries often have books or ebooks to borrow for free. 

* Ask Me About My Uterus
* Beating Endo

## Treatment options:

These article provide information on the available endometriosis treatments with special attention paid to the limitations and risks of each method, including surgery and medications. 

* Excision vs ablation
* Birth control methods/ Side Effects

## Finding a Specialist:

Though endometriosis is a common condition affecting 176 billion people worldwide, there are very few specialists in the medical community. In the US it is estimated that there are only 200 excision surgeons in practice. Finding a knowledgable and compassionate provider can be one of the hardest aspects of managing this disease. Without proper medical support, the symptoms can become chronic comorbidities that will need their own medical intervention. 

## Holistic Natural Approach:

These resources provide insight on dietary and lifestyle changes that can aid in the healing process and a whole body approach when it comes to treatments.

## Support:

Finding adequate support, receiving validating, and maintaining one's self worth and dignity are all important components of disease management and basic human rights.
