# What is Endometriosis? (this is H1, prevent this)

> Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue _similar_ to the lining inside the uterus (called “the endometrium”), is found _outside_ the uterus, where it induces a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in scar tissue.  It is primarily found on the pelvic peritoneum, on the ovaries, in the recto-vaginal septum, on the bladder, and bowel. **(NOTE: We talked about the block quote having stylized quotation marks with my red color and no indentation.)**

> Endometriosis is a puzzling disease that affects our hormones, our immune system (the system that fights germs and cancer), and the digestive tract (the system involved in the breakdown and absorption of our food).

> Endometriosis is a condition where tissue that is somewhat similar to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is found outside the uterus where it does not belong. This abnormal tissue contains endometrial glands and stroma. The glands secrete substances that irritate the surrounding tissues, sometimes causing them to bleed. The immune system responds to the release of these substances by releasing inflammatory proteins that rush to the site of disease, causing swelling and inflammation. The disease itself and the inflammatory response to the disease can cause the patient severe pelvic pain. Over time, scar tissue may form and bands of scarring may develop, sticking the pelvic organs together (adhesions).

## **Online Resources (H2)**:

Here are trusted informational online resources that explain the definition, believed causes, and treatment options available for the disease:

* [endo](http://endometriosis.org/)
* [Endometriosis.org](http://endometriosis.org/)

## Books (H2):

These books cover an array of information on the disease so I would suggest reading as many as you can or choosing the topic most relevant to your case. Use your local library to access these books for free. Libraries often have books or ebooks to borrow for free. 

* Ask Me About My Uterus
* Beating Endo

## Treatment options:

These article provide information on the available endometriosis treatments with special attention paid to the limitations and risks of each method, including surgery and medications. 

* Excision vs ablation
* Birth control methods/ Side Effects

## Finding a Specialist:

Though endometriosis is a common condition affecting 176 billion people worldwide, there are very few specialists in the medical community. In the US it is estimated that there are only 200 excision surgeons in practice. Finding a knowledgable and compassionate provider can be one of the hardest aspects of managing this disease. Without proper medical support, the symptoms can become chronic comorbidities that will need their own medical intervention. 

## Holistic Natural Approach:

These resources provide insight on dietary and lifestyle changes that can aid in the healing process and a whole body approach when it comes to treatments.

## Support:

Finding adequate support, receiving validating, and maintaining one's self worth and dignity are all important components of disease management and basic human rights.
