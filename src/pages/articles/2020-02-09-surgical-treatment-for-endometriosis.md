<h2>What are the Surgical Options?</h2>

The medical treatment of endometriosis involves surgery. Endometriosis surgery is considered to be one of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIVCGwNYAQfzW1ULc4CIEtxeN2eAVOjv/view?fbclid=IwAR0C80P8GY_oUzcNUPBERyXbL8I71LRXYSwUp6Zl3YzCfEUCype56z9c0Cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most complex and difficult surgeries</a> in the human body. There are several surgical options currently available. It is important to learn about each surgical method and your doctor's approach to endometriosis surgery to make the best informed decision for your care. 

It's important to note that surgery with a confirmation of biopsy specimens is the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only definitive diagnostic tool</a> for confirming endometriosis. Laparoscopy surgery is the most common diagnostic surgery and is also considered a <a href="https://womenssurgerycentertn.com/122/endometriosis-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cornerstone of treatment</a> for the disease. Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which the endometriosis lesions are removed. 

<h3>Excision</h3>

During laparoscopy, the surgical options of removal include excision and superficial treatments such as ablation, fulguration, diathermy, vaporization, cautery, etc. Laparoscopic excision, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAPEX</a>, is defined by the full removal of the entire lesion where it is found. Superficial treatments are as they sound and only target the lesion's surface.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Endometriosis acts like an iceberg.  Despite the disease being identified above the surface of the tissue, the majority is implanted into the tissue below the surface. This is why it is so important to find a surgeon who removes lesions in their entirety.

<cite><a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- The Endometriosis Foundation of America</a></cite>

</blockquote>

Since endometriosis lesions are often <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deeply imbedded</a> in the surrounding tissue, a thorough approach like excision is needed for complete removal. During excision surgery, the lesions are excised or cut out and the tissue underneath is evaluated for abnormal tissue and removed if necessary.  

<blockquote class="blockquote">Laparoscopic Excision (LAPEX) is the surgical cornerstone of any high quality, multidisciplinary approach to correctly treating endometriosis. LAPEX allows for the disease to be meticulously removed, cut out, from all areas, without damaging surrounding structures or removing otherwise healthy organs.

<cite><a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- The Center for Endometriosis Care</a></cite>

</blockquote>

Studies have found the complete removal of the entire lesion is necessary for symptom relief and successful disease management. LAPEX has been associated with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1833246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> low rate of minimal persistent/recurrent disease</a> and <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptomatic improvements</a> in general health, sexual function, fertility, and quality of life. When performed by an advanced surgeon, the outcomes of excision are far superior to superficial treatments and have a <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-operation rate of 20%</a>. In comparison, the re-operation rate for superficial treatments is 80%.

<blockquote class="blockquote">The high rates of recurrence associated with endometriosis surgery in the literature strongly depend on the completeness of disease removal. LAPEX is a well-established yet under-practiced approach, with the goal at the time of surgery to completely respect all disease, restore normal anatomy, and apply measures for adhesion prevention. Data suggest that the surgical objective should be complete eradication; therefore, the surgeon must be prepared to excise all lesions suggestive of endometriosis as well as all atypical tissue, because in most anatomic sites, approximately 50% of atypical specimens prove to be endometriosis.

<h3>Ablation</h3>

Since lesions are deeply implanted in the surrounding tissue, superficial treatments leave much of the disease behind, untouched, and remaining to further progress. This explains the high recurrence of re-operation for superficial methods. <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adhesion formations</a> can also increase substantially due to the presence of residual endometriosis, even in small amounts. The high heat and energy used during surgery can also damage surrounding healthy tissue leading to excess scar tissue. Superficial treatments, like ablation, cannot reach deep
implants so there are <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIVCGwNYAQfzW1ULc4CIEtxeN2eAVOjv/view?fbclid=IwAR0C80P8GY_oUzcNUPBERyXbL8I71LRXYSwUp6Zl3YzCfEUCype56z9c0Cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no tissues for pathology</a> to confirm the diagnosis.

<blockquote class="blockquote">In most cases, ablation/cauterization surgery will not be effective for long-term management of endometriosis because the tissue remains below the surface. In many cases, the inflammation following ablation and cauterization can be another source of pain. This is why excision surgery is the gold standard for treatment. If a patient is considering surgery, it is important that they ask their surgeon the method for removal.

<cite><a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- Endometriosis Foundation of America</a></cite>

</blockquote>

As with any surgery there are risks and surgical complications to consider. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIVCGwNYAQfzW1ULc4CIEtxeN2eAVOjv/view?fbclid=IwAR0C80P8GY_oUzcNUPBERyXbL8I71LRXYSwUp6Zl3YzCfEUCype56z9c0Cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complications</a> during endometriosis surgery can include damage to organs, thermal and direct traumas, and excessive bleeding. After surgery complications can include infections, urinary and bowel difficulties, and prolonged vaginal bleeding. Due to the intensity of deep infiltrating endometriosis surgery there are other complications to consider including, urinary tract injuries, vascular lesions, and liver injury.

<h3>Excision Specialists</h3> 

While the type of surgery ultimately matters, the skill of the surgeon defines the quality of surgery for patients. Unfortunately, a majority of gynecologists are only trained in superficial methods such as cauterization or ablation. Due to the lack of knowledgeable providers,  it's estimated that there are only <a href="https://www.endofound.org/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-an-endometriosis-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less than 200 excision surgeons</a> worldwide for a patient population of 175 million people. Clearly there is a stark lack of support which makes appropriate care even more scarce. Excision surgery is commonly not covered by health insurance and is also one of the most expensive options, making it inaccessible for many patients. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">Who performs the surgery, how and when is of critical importance, however; excision is a highly advanced surgical technique requiring extensive training. Likewise, accuracy in diagnosis and treatment is dependent on the ability of the surgeon to recognize disease in all its different manifestations. This means, if the surgeon is not familiar with all signs of endometriosis...then disease will be missed and left behind untreated; surgeons can only see and treat what they recognize.

<cite><a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- Center for Endometriosis Care</a></cite>

</blockquote>

When considering surgery, LAPEX is considered the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gold standard of care</a>, or the best available option, for endometriosis. This is based on clinical trails that look at the long term outcomes of LAPEX compared to other treatments. As discussed above, the skill and clinical experience of the surgeon is equally important to a patient's outcome and should also be considered before surgery. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">In the medical field, a 'gold standard' treatment for a disease is one that has been proven through validated clinical trials to have the best long-term outcomes and the least complications when compared to other methods of treatment. It simply means that there is no better treatment. In the case of surgical management for treatment of endometriosis, the gold standard is now complete and total surgical excision of any and all visible implants of endometriosis with wide margins around all endometriosis and removal of all underlying scar tissue.

<h3>Why is Hysterectomy not a treatment option?</h3>

Hysterectomy is not a suitable treatment option for endometriosis. Since endometriosis is found outside of the reproductive organs, removing the uterus does not remove the disease. Since there is no cure for endometriosis, hysterectomy is not a cure. Endometriosis can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127534?fbclid=IwAR1PCTJ0BUkHuiB03sg8QrKMECRCFjofBmpSDSc3ipADCLww5NyuLK2asvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> remain symptomatic</a> after hysterectomy, with or without estrogen therapy. It is recommended that excision be used during castration to remove endometriosis. Hysterectomy can be used to treat other conditions that can be gynaecological comorbidities of endometriosis, including <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIVCGwNYAQfzW1ULc4CIEtxeN2eAVOjv/view?fbclid=IwAR0C80P8GY_oUzcNUPBERyXbL8I71LRXYSwUp6Zl3YzCfEUCype56z9c0Cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adenomyosis and fibroids</a>. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">It is a common myth that having a hysterectomy will cure endometriosis. There is no cure for endometriosis and a hysterectomy is rarely the best treatment. Most endometriosis is located in areas other than the reproductive organs. If you simply remove the uterus and do not excise the remaining lesions, the patient will continue to have pain.
