Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This article and site are dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers. 

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This part two of the series on Endometriosis. (maybe add that tag to drop it down to table of contents)

<blockquote>A common myth is that endometriosis only affects a patient during their period– while this may be the case for some patients, for most patients the pain affects them both during and outside their period. <cite>

Endometriosis is often improperly described as bad cramps and incorrectly associated with menses. This couldn’t be further from the truth for many patients. While some will experience symptoms cyclical to their menstrual cycle, many more will experience a gradual worsening of symptoms that can become chronic in nature. For example, some patients will only have pain and dysfunction surrounding their ovulation and menstruation. More commonly, a patient will experience <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> daily symptoms </a> that intensify and become further debilitating over time. On the other hand, there are patients who remain completely asymptomatic despite having the disease. There is a poor correlation between the stage of the disease and the severity of the symptoms. Due to the <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11523.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">varying presentations</a> and symptoms, no two patients present with the same symptoms or comorbidities. 

To further complicate the presentation of symptoms, endometriosis is found to have many comorbidities, or related conditions. Possible comorbidities include migraines, asthma, allergies, hypothyroidism, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis.
