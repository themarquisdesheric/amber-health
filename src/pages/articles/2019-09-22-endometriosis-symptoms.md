Endometriosis is much more than simple, so-called 'killer cramps,' as it is often mistakenly labeled, with symptoms routinely occurring apart from menses at any time of the cycle and, in many instances, becoming chronic in nature. Not all persons with endometriosis will have all symptoms or comorbidities, of course, and no two cases are identical.

Endometriosis presents with a number of different symptoms and different appearances, and there is a poor correlation between the extent of the disease and the severity of the symptoms.

<blockquote>

While some patients are relatively symptom-free except for certain times of their cycles (menstruation and ovulation), others are debilitated by pain each and every day of the month. Many patients experience a gradual worsening of symptoms over time, both in severity and in the duration of symptoms i.e., the number of days per month they are affected. A common myth is that endometriosis only affects a patient during their period – while this may be the case for some patients, for most patients the pain affects them both during and outside their period.
