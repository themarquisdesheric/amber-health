Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers. 

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This part two of the series on Endometriosis. **(tag to TOC)**

A common myth is that endometriosis only affects a patient during their period. While this may be the case for some patients, for most patients the pain affects them both during and outside their period.

Endometriosis is often improperly described as bad cramps and incorrectly associated with menses. This couldn’t be further from the truth for many patients. While some will experience symptoms cyclical to their menstrual cycle, many more will experience a gradual worsening of symptoms that can become chronic in nature. For example, some patients will only have pain and dysfunction surrounding their ovulation and menstruation. More commonly, a patient will experience <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> daily symptoms </a> that intensify and become further debilitating over time. On the other hand, there are patients who remain completely asymptomatic despite having the disease. There is a poor correlation between the stage of the disease and the severity of the symptoms. Due to the <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11523.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">varying presentations</a> and symptoms, no two patients present with the same symptoms or comorbidities. 

To further complicate the presentation of symptoms, endometriosis is found to have many comorbidities, or related conditions. Possible <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12351553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comorbidities</a> include migraines, asthma, allergies, hypothyroidism, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. Since endometriosis is commonly located in the pelvic cavity chronic pelvic pain is another significant comorbidity. Pelvic structures including the bowel and bladder are often affected. Tellingly called the “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evil twins</a>”, endometriosis is often associated with interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome. Endo patients are also at a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25765863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher risk</a> of ovarian and breast cancers and some autoimmune, cardiovascular, and atopic diseases. There is no current explanation or understanding in how these conditions overlap but the prevalence is significant. Further research is needed to understand the connection between these conditions. 

<blockquote>

Increasing evidence suggests that endometriosis patients are at higher risk of several chronic diseases. Although the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood, the available data to date suggest that endometriosis is not harmless with respects to patient’s long-term health.

When approaching medical treatment and care, it’s important to understand that there are wide reaching effects to having multiple diseases. Healthcare providers who do not address this reality will not be able to treat endometriosis or manage the symptoms successfully. The complexity of endo and the diversity of related conditions demand a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multidisciplinary approach</a> to care. Often this will entail the care of several specialists, including gynecologists, urologists, gastroenterologists, acupuncturists, and physical therapists. A further discussion on treatment options can be found in my article, **Endometriosis Treatments (add link).**

<h3>Key facts to keep in mind as you seek care</h3>

* Be wary of providers who believe your pain and symptoms must relate to your menses. This is not accurate for most patients. 
* Endometriosis and its related conditions manifest as a unique presentation in each patient so no two patients have the same symptoms and comorbidities. 
* Do not accept a dismissal of your specific symptoms as unrelated. You should be heard and your symptoms should be further investigated and ruled out accordingly. 
* The effects of having multiple diseases is wide reaching and demands a multidisciplinary approach to care.

While endometriosis remains largely unknown, theories abound. In my next article, [Endometriosis Potential Causes](/articles/2019-09-24-endometriosis-potential-causes/) the main theories are examined.
