<h2>What Are the Alternative and Complementary Therapies?</h2>

A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach</a> that is individualized to the patient’s needs will provide the most successful, long-term outcome in endometriosis management. Often this involves receiving care from a variety of doctors and specialists to properly address a wide range of symptoms. This can include working with a gynecologist, nutritionist, integrative doctor, urologist, and many other types of healthcare providers. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108065/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> has shown several potential benefits to <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(15)00753-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complementary and alternative therapies</a> for endometriosis patients. Examples of complementary therapies include physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and meditation. These therapies use various methods to potentially <a href="http://www.endometriosis.co.uk/complementary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mitigate symptoms, reduce pain or stress, and aid disease management</a>. 

<blockquote>The majority of patients with chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis have additional related comorbidities. This preliminary data suggests that a thorough approach that addresses these additional processes that contribute to chronic pelvic pain may be a key factor in maintaining such re-operation rates lower than previously reported for patients with endometriosis.

At UC San Diego's Center for Endometriosis Research and Treatment, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrative medicine</a> accounted for 43% of the referrals made outside of the core patient-gynecologist team. Physical therapy accounted for 11% of the referrals patients received. Specialists at this center recognize and stress the importance of a multidisciplinary program that reflects the individual needs and wishes of their patients. Again and again, specialists emphasize the importance of establishing a comprehensive approach that includes <a href="https://www.jogc.com/article/S1701-2163(20)30013-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speciality clinics</a>, which are solely dedicated to treating endometriosis and include complementary modalities. 

Using complementary and alternative medicine allows patients to make informed decisions about their health and to manage their chronic illness. Research has found chronically ill patients practice complementary and alternative medicines as a personal responsibility for their health and as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12231024?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a critical aspect of self-care management</a>. Patients with endometriosis have turned to self-management due to frustration at the lack of effective medical treatments. Self-management may help patients with endometriosis <a href="https://bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2431-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel empowered and have a sense of agency</a>.

<div class="page-break Slice1"></div>

<blockquote>The findings confirm that complementary and alternative medicine use can be understood as a critical component of self-care management in general, and not as a rejection of conventional medicine or an unrealistic search for cure. In contrast, it represents personal responsibility for health, reframing the measures by which therapeutics are evaluated, and adopting a pragmatic approach to living as well as possible in the context of a chronic condition.
