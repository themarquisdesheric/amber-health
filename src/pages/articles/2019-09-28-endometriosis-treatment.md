Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This **Part Four** of the series on Endometriosis. **(tag to TOC)**

<h2>What are the Treatment options?</h2>

Currently there is no cure or preventative treatment for endometriosis. There are several treatment options available that can help in disease management. However, few options actually target the disease and most only address the symptoms. Each treatment has its own benefits, limitations, and risks to consider. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contemporary treatments</a> are based upon the surgical removal of lesions and medical strategies that suppress estrogen or menses. Due to the complexity of endometriosis and its symptoms, these strategies do not provide a suitable model of care for patients long term. While there have been efforts to define guidelines by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">various associations</a>, the best treatments for endometriosis still remain controversial and under debate. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The current system’s inability to adequately address endometriosis pain symptoms often results in the emergence of broader functional sequela and psychological impact. The ability to address these broader impacts is crucial and certainly requires a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care.

Specialists do agree that <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach</a> to care is necessary to address the many comorbidities and complexities of the disease. A multidisciplinary approach often means seeking out a variety of doctors and specialties to widen the scope of your care. A gynecologist will perform the diagnostic surgery, surgical treatment, and provide referrals to other healthcare providers.  Combining treatments, such as excision surgery, diet and nutrition, alternative therapies, and physical therapy, can lead to patients effectively managing the disease and their symptoms long term. Patients will also need a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly individualized patient-focused approach</a> to care since no two patients have the same presentation of symptoms. It’s also important that the specialists communicate effectively with one another to bridge the gaps in their knowledge.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Patients with endometriosis often require individualized care over a long-term period, where priorities may change depending upon the type and severity of symptoms, the impact of these symptoms, current or future fertility goals and lifestyle factors. Individualized care benefits from a multi-disciplinary network of experts sufficiently skilled in providing advice on and treatment of endometriosis and its associated symptoms, based on the best available knowledge, their extensive experience, and their transparent record of success rates.

Receiving long term care from a variety of specialists can become extremely costly making it inaccessible for many patients. Due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an antiquated approach</a> to managing complex chronic diseases, insurance policies do not cover complementary treatments and often healthcare providers do not offer them.

<blockquote class="blockquote"> This (single-provider) model of care for a complex chronic disease without a cure can pose challenges for both patients and care providers. With limited complementary strategies, such as mental health, acupuncture, nutrition, and pelvic physical therapy expertise to comprehensively address the patient’s pain and its consequences, optimal care may not be achieved.

 For US patients,  ACOG, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, defines the standard of care for endometriosis and ultimately influences what treatments insurance companies will cover. Despite recent data points, patient outcry, and a pushback from specialists, <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2018/11/08/too-often-quality-of-life-for-endometriosis-patients-is-dictated-by-their-financial-resources/?fbclid=IwAR3QhTFx0Gt56Q2ZqS_PJTGm7KuHUpVOyLjojMJXhecodYFhanHB5RFmjaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACOG’s guidelines </a> remain ineffective and outdated and include palliative hormonal medications and ineffective surgeries such as hysterectomies. If ACOG were to recognize excision surgery and the multidisciplinary care approach, insurance companies would be compelled to provide coverage for treatments. 

<blockquote class="blockquote"> The care patients can get varies massively around the world and within countries, and is often dependent on what they can afford. In the US, insurance companies pay the same amount for any endometriosis surgery, regardless of the method or extent of the disease or the specialization of the doctor.<cite><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/28/endometriosis-hidden-suffering-millions-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Sarah Boseley, The Guardian </a></cite>

In the US and all over the world, patients quality of care is often defined by what they can afford. Unfortunately, the bulk of the burden falls on the patient to pursue these services and to pay for them out of pocket. This can delay care and/or make it completely impossible to receive treatment. Without adequate treatment the disease will progress and likely become more debilitating over time. The burden of cost is two fold for an endometriosis patient: the cost of medical treatments and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cost of lost productivity</a>. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The economic burden associated with endometriosis treated in referral centres is high and is similar to other chronic diseases (diabetes, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis). It arises predominantly from productivity loss, and is predicted by decreased quality of life.<cite><a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/5/1292/700268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Steven Simoens, MSc, PhD</a></cite>

</blockquote>

Clearly the hurdles to care for endometriosis are multidimensional and require an immense amount of resources, dedicated time, and access to medical care. For patients already burdened with illness, navigating a broken healthcare system and receiving inadequate care only further <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15154905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detracts from their quality of life</a>. 

As a patient, being informed on the available treatments can help you advocate for your health needs and select the most appropriate options. Unfortunately, the onus is on the patient to become informed and educate the medical community. The following sections will provide a detailed look at many of the available treatments for endometriosis.

<h3>Surgery</h3>

It's important to note surgery with confirmation of biopsy specimens is the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only definitive diagnostic tool</a> for confirming endometriosis. Laparoscopy surgery is the most common diagnostic surgery and is also considered a <a href="https://womenssurgerycentertn.com/122/endometriosis-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cornerstone of treatment</a> for the disease. Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which the endometriosis lesions are removed. 

During laparoscopy, the surgical options of removal include excision and superficial treatments such as fulguration, diathermy, vaporization, cautery, etc. Laparoscopic Excision, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAPEX</a>, is defined by the full removal of the entire lesion where it is found. Superficial treatments are as they sound and only target the lesion's surface.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Endometriosis acts like an iceberg.  Despite the disease being identified above the surface of the tissue, the majority is implanted into the tissue below the surface. This is why it is so important to find a surgeon who removes lesions in their entirety.

<cite><a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-The Endometriosis Foundation of America</cite>

</blockquote>

Since endometriosis lesions are often <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deeply imbedded</a> in the surrounding tissue, a thorough approach, like excision, is needed for complete removal. During excision surgery, the lesions are excised or cut out and the tissue underneath is evaluated for abnormal tissue and removed if necessary.  

<blockquote class="blockquote">Laparoscopic Excision (LAPEX) is the surgical cornerstone of any high quality, multidisciplinary approach to correctly treating endometriosis. LAPEX allows for the disease to be meticulously removed, cut out, from all areas, without damaging surrounding structures or removing otherwise healthy organs.

<cite><a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-The Center for Endometriosis Care</cite>

</blockquote>

Studies have found the complete removal of the entire lesion is necessary for symptom relief and successful disease management. LAPEX has been associated with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1833246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> low rate of minimal persistent/recurrent disease</a> and <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptomatic improvements</a> in general health, sexual function, fertility, and quality of life. When performed by an advanced surgeon, the outcomes of excision are far superior to superficial treatments and have a <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-operation rate of 20%</a>. In comparison, the re-operation rate for superficial treatments in 80%.

<blockquote class="blockquote">The high rates of recurrence associated with endometriosis surgery in the literature strongly depend on the completeness of disease removal. LAPEX is a well-established yet under-practiced approach, with the goal at the time of surgery to completely respect all disease, restore normal anatomy, and apply measures for adhesion prevention. Data suggest that the surgical objective should be complete eradication; therefore, the surgeon must be prepared to excise all lesions suggestive of endometriosis as well as all atypical tissue, because in most anatomic sites, approximately 50% of atypical specimens prove to be endometriosis.

</blockquote>

For the same reasons that deep excision is successful in disease management, superficial treatments are not. Due to the deeply implanted lesions in the surrounding tissue, superficial treatments leave much of the disease untouched and left behind to further progress. Adhesions formation can also increase substantially due to the presence of residual endometriosis. The high heat and energy used can also damage surrounding healthy tissue leading to excess scar tissue.
