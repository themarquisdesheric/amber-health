Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This **Part Four** of the series on Endometriosis. **(tag to TOC)**

<h2>What are the Treatment options?</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote">There is an urgent need to rethink endometriosis care in order to provide a more comprehensive, patient-focused approach with long-term goals.

Currently there is no cure or preventative treatment for endometriosis. There are several treatment options available that can help in disease management. However, few options actually target the disease and most only address the symptoms. Each treatment has its own benefits, limitations, and risks to consider. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contemporary treatments</a> are based upon the surgical removal of lesions and medical strategies that suppress estrogen or menses. Due to the complexity of endometriosis and its symptoms, these strategies do not provide a suitable model of care for patients long term. While there have been efforts to define guidelines by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">various associations</a>, the best treatments for endometriosis still remain controversial and under debate. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The current system’s inability to adequately address endometriosis pain symptoms often results in the emergence of broader functional sequela and psychological impact. The ability to address these broader impacts is crucial and certainly requires a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care. 

<cite><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Sanjay Agarwal, MD, FACOG</a></cite>

Specialists do agree that <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach</a> to care is necessary to address the many comorbidities and complexities of the disease. A multidisciplinary approach often means seeking out a variety of doctors and specialties to widen the scope of your care. A gynecologist will perform the diagnostic surgery, surgical treatment, and provide referrals to other healthcare providers.  Combining treatments, such as excision surgery, diet and nutrition, alternative therapies, and physical therapy, can lead to patients effectively managing the disease and their symptoms long term. Patients will also need a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly individualized patient-focused approach</a> to care since no two patients have the same presentation of symptoms. It’s also important that the specialists communicate effectively with one another to bridge the gaps in their knowledge.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Patients with endometriosis often require individualized care over a long-term period, where priorities may change depending upon the type and severity of symptoms, the impact of these symptoms, current or future fertility goals and lifestyle factors. Individualized care benefits from a multi-disciplinary network of experts sufficiently skilled in providing advice on and treatment of endometriosis and its associated symptoms, based on the best available knowledge, their extensive experience, and their transparent record of success rates.

Receiving long term care from a variety of specialists can become extremely costly making it inaccessible for many patients. Due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an antiquated approach</a> to managing complex chronic diseases, insurance policies do not cover complementary treatments and often healthcare providers do not offer them.

<blockquote class="blockquote"> This (single-provider) model of care for a complex chronic disease without a cure can pose challenges for both patients and care providers. With limited complementary strategies, such as mental health, acupuncture, nutrition, and pelvic physical therapy expertise to comprehensively address the patient’s pain and its consequences, optimal care may not be achieved.

</blockquote>

 For US patients,  ACOG, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, defines the standard of care for endometriosis and ultimately influences what treatments insurance companies will cover. Despite recent data points, patient outcry, and a pushback from specialists, <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2018/11/08/too-often-quality-of-life-for-endometriosis-patients-is-dictated-by-their-financial-resources/?fbclid=IwAR3QhTFx0Gt56Q2ZqS_PJTGm7KuHUpVOyLjojMJXhecodYFhanHB5RFmjaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACOG’s guidelines </a> remain ineffective and outdated and include palliative hormonal medications and ineffective surgeries such as hysterectomies. If ACOG were to recognize excision surgery and the multidisciplinary care approach, insurance companies would be compelled to provide coverage for treatments. 

<blockquote class="blockquote"> The care patients can get varies massively around the world and within countries, and is often dependent on what they can afford. In the US, insurance companies pay the same amount for any endometriosis surgery, regardless of the method or extent of the disease or the specialization of the doctor.<cite><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/28/endometriosis-hidden-suffering-millions-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Sarah Boseley, The Guardian </a></cite>

</blockquote>

In the US and all over the world, patients quality of care is often defined by what they can afford. Unfortunately, the bulk of the burden falls on the patient to pursue these services and to pay for them out of pocket. This can delay care and/or make it completely impossible to receive treatment. Without adequate treatment the disease will progress and likely become more debilitating over time. The burden of cost is two fold for an endometriosis patient: the cost of medical treatments and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cost of lost productivity</a>. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The economic burden associated with endometriosis treated in referral centres is high and is similar to other chronic diseases (diabetes, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis). It arises predominantly from productivity loss, and is predicted by decreased quality of life.<cite><a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/27/5/1292/700268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Steven Simoens, MSc, PhD</a></cite>

</blockquote>

Clearly the hurdles to care for endometriosis are multidimensional and require an immense amount of resources, dedicated time, and access to medical care. For patients already burdened with illness, navigating a broken healthcare system and receiving inadequate care only further <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15154905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detracts from their quality of life</a>. 

As a patient, being informed on the available treatments can help you advocate for your health needs and select the most appropriate options. Unfortunately, the onus is on the patient to become informed and educate the medical community. The following sections will provide a detailed look at many of the available treatments for endometriosis. 

* Surgery: Excision vs Ablation 
* Hormonal Therapy
* Alternative Therapies
* Pain Management

<h3>Surgery</h3>

It's important to note surgery with confirmation of biopsy specimens is the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only definitive diagnostic tool</a> for confirming endometriosis. Laparoscopy surgery is the most common diagnostic surgery and is also considered a <a href="https://womenssurgerycentertn.com/122/endometriosis-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cornerstone of treatment</a> for the disease. Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which the endometriosis lesions are removed. 

During laparoscopy, the surgical options of removal include excision and superficial treatments such as fulguration, diathermy, vaporization, cautery, etc. Laparoscopic Excision, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAPEX</a>, is defined by the full removal of the entire lesion where it is found. Superficial treatments are as they sound and only target the lesion's surface.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Endometriosis acts like an iceberg.  Despite the disease being identified above the surface of the tissue, the majority is implanted into the tissue below the surface. This is why it is so important to find a surgeon who removes lesions in their entirety.

<cite><a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-The Endometriosis Foundation of America</cite>

</blockquote>

Since endometriosis lesions are often <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deeply imbedded</a> in the surrounding tissue, a thorough approach, like excision, is needed for complete removal. During excision surgery, the lesions are excised or cut out and the tissue underneath is evaluated for abnormal tissue and removed if necessary.  

<blockquote class="blockquote">Laparoscopic Excision (LAPEX) is the surgical cornerstone of any high quality, multidisciplinary approach to correctly treating endometriosis. LAPEX allows for the disease to be meticulously removed, cut out, from all areas, without damaging surrounding structures or removing otherwise healthy organs.

<cite><a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-The Center for Endometriosis Care</cite>

</blockquote>

Studies have found the complete removal of the entire lesion is necessary for symptom relief and successful disease management. LAPEX has been associated with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1833246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> low rate of minimal persistent/recurrent disease</a> and <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptomatic improvements</a> in general health, sexual function, fertility, and quality of life. When performed by an advanced surgeon, the outcomes of excision are far superior to superficial treatments and have a <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-operation rate of 20%</a>. In comparison, the re-operation rate for superficial treatments in 80%.

<blockquote class="blockquote">The high rates of recurrence associated with endometriosis surgery in the literature strongly depend on the completeness of disease removal. LAPEX is a well-established yet under-practiced approach, with the goal at the time of surgery to completely respect all disease, restore normal anatomy, and apply measures for adhesion prevention. Data suggest that the surgical objective should be complete eradication; therefore, the surgeon must be prepared to excise all lesions suggestive of endometriosis as well as all atypical tissue, because in most anatomic sites, approximately 50% of atypical specimens prove to be endometriosis.

<cite><a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Ken R. Sinervo, MD, MSC, FRCSC, ACGE</cite>

</blockquote>

Due to the deeply implanted lesions in the surrounding tissue, superficial treatments leave much of the disease untouched and left behind to further progress. This explains the high recurrence of re-operation for superficial methods. <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adhesion formations</a> can also increase substantially due to the presence of residual endometriosis, even in small amounts. The high heat and energy used during surgery can also damage surrounding healthy tissue leading to excess scar tissue.

<blockquote class="blockquote">In most cases, ablation/cauterization surgery will not be effective for long-term management of endometriosis because the tissue remains below the surface. In many cases, the inflammation following ablation and cauterization can be another source of pain. This is why excision surgery is the gold standard for treatment. If a patient is considering surgery, it is important that they ask their surgeon the method for removal.

<cite><a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Endometriosis Foundation of America</cite>

</blockquote>

While the type of surgery ultimately matters, the skill of the surgeon defines the quality of surgery for patients. Unfortunately, a majority of gynecologists are only trained in superficial methods such as cauterization or ablation. Due to the lack of knowledgeable providers,  it's estimated that there are only [100-200 excision surgeons](https://www.endofound.org/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-an-endometriosis-specialist) worldwide for a patient population of 175 million people. Clearly there is a stark lack of support which makes appropriate care even more scarce. Excision is commonly not covered by health insurance and is also one of the most expensive options, making it inaccessible for many patients. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">Who performs the surgery, how and when is of critical importance, however; excision is a highly advanced surgical technique requiring extensive training. Likewise, accuracy in diagnosis and treatment is dependent on the ability of the surgeon to recognize disease in all its different manifestations. This means, if the surgeon is not familiar with all signs of endometriosis...then disease will be missed and left behind untreated; surgeons can only see and treat what they recognize.

<cite><a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Center for Endometriosis Care</cite>

</blockquote>

When considering surgery, LAPEX is considered the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/lapex-laparoscopic-excision-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gold standard of care</a>, or the best available option, for endometriosis. The skill and clinical experience of the surgeon is equally important to a patient's outcome and should also be considered before surgery. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">In the medical field, a 'gold standard' treatment for a disease is one that has been proven through validated clinical trials to have the best long-term outcomes and the least complications when compared to other methods of treatment. It simply means that there is no better treatment. In the case of surgical management for treatment of endometriosis, the gold standard is now complete and total surgical excision of any and all visible implants of endometriosis with wide margins around all endometriosis and removal of all underlying scar tissue.

</blockquote>

**Why Hysterectomy is not a treatment option?**

<blockquote class="blockquote">It is a common myth that having a hysterectomy will cure endometriosis. There is no cure for endometriosis and a hysterectomy is rarely the best treatment. Most endometriosis is located in areas other than the reproductive organs. If you simply remove the uterus and do not excise the remaining lesions, the patient will continue to have pain.

<cite><a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Endometriosis Foundation of America</cite>

</blockquote>

Hysterectomy is not a suitable treatment option for endometriosis. Endometriosis can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127534?fbclid=IwAR1PCTJ0BUkHuiB03sg8QrKMECRCFjofBmpSDSc3ipADCLww5NyuLK2asvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> remain symptomatic</a> after hysterectomy, with or without estrogen therapy. It is recommended that excision be used during castration to remove the disease. 

<h3>Hormonal Contraceptives and Hormone Therapy</h3>

Many doctors offer hormonal contraceptives and hormonal therapies as a first line treatment option to an endometriosis patient. Hormone therapy can come in the form of birth control pills, progesterone only pills, progesterone medicines, and GnRH agonists, like Lupron. 

While oral contraceptives and hormonal therapy are the most commonly prescribed medications for endometriosis, they are proven to not <a href="http://endopaedia.info/diagnosis12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eradicate</a>, <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop progression</a>, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve the disease</a>.

<blockquote class="blockquote">Medical therapy represents only a symptomatic treatment and not the definitive solution to endometriosis lesions that may persist despite different medications, dosages, and duration of the therapy

</blockquote>

In theory, hormonal suppression is thought to decrease endometriosis tissue activity by halting menses. However, there are <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several problems</a> with this approach. Although suppressed, the endometriosis is still <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressing and growing deeper</a>. Since the disease was never removed, the endometriosis tissue will reactivate once suppression stops and <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms will return</a>. <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High recurrence rates</a> of disease are associated with all hormonal medical options.

<blockquote class="blockquote">All medical therapy, whether administered as first-line treatment or postoperatively, is associated with high rates of disease recurrence.

<cite><a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>-Ken R. Sinervo, MD, MSC, FRCSC, ACGE</cite>

</blockquote>

Despite the proven ineffectiveness, most providers still offer hormonal suppression as a “treatment”.  Few are educated on the  <a href="https://drbrighten.com/the-contraception-guide/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Happy+World+Contraception+Day%21&utm_campaign=Happy+World+Contraception+Day%21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risks, side effects, and limitations</a> and in turn, cannot educate their patients. Too often, they fail to inform patients that hormone therapy can only provide <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptomatic relief</a>, if even that, while the disease will continue to progress and grow deeper. It's important to remember that hormonal suppression cannot eradicate the disease,   <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot improve fertility</a>, and has shown no effect on adhesions. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">In the general healthcare community including at the OB/GYN level, it is taught (and hence practiced) that the most frequent mainstays of treatment are medical suppressives and incomplete surgery. Medication does not eradicate endometriosis, however, and the disease does not simply ‘go away’ as a result of drug suppression. At best, such a course of therapy provides only a temporary means of symptom improvement, not definitive treatment. Often, side effects are significantly negative and intolerable, and may last far beyond the cessation of treatment. Poor outcomes on suppression therapies are routine: drug therapy that can destroy endometriosis permanently has yet to be discovered. Hormonal suppression has 'no effect on adhesion of endometriotic cells and cannot improve fertility'.

Due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insufficient evidence</a>, no definitive conclusions could be made about the overall superiority of any particular hormonal contraceptive. However, after a review of the literature, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supportive data was determined to be of low quality or insufficient</a> to reach conclusions.

Further studies are needed to confirm if there is any benefit to using Elagolix instead of the currently practiced hormonal therapies. Additional studies are also needed to rule out any long-term safety risks for patients. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The New England CEPAC voted that evidence was not adequate to determine whether elagolix offers a net health benefit compared to no treatment, or compared to treatment with either a GnRH agonist (leuprorelin acetate) or a hormonal contraceptive (depot medroxyprogesterone), due to limited and mixed evidence on clinical effectiveness and potential risks. Since endometriosis-related symptoms recur after stopping treatment, it remains to be determined whether elagolix is safe or effective for long term use.
