Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This **Part Four** of the series on Endometriosis. **(tag to TOC)**

## What are the Treatment options?

Currently there is no cure or preventative treatment for endometriosis. However, there are several treatment options available that can help in disease management. Very few treatments actually target the disease, while many others only address the symptoms.  Each treatment has its own benefits, limitations, and risks to consider. Specialists agree that a multidisciplinary approach to care is necessary to address the many comorbidities and complexities of the disease. A multidisciplinary approach often means seeking out a variety of doctors and specialties to widen the scope of your care. Combining treatments, such as excision surgery, diet and nutrition, alternative therapies, and physical therapy, can lead to patients effectively managing the disease and their symptoms long term.

Quality surgery, alternative therapies, diet and nutrition, acupuncture, physical therapy and other adjunct treatments can all be helpful in effectively managing symptoms long term.
