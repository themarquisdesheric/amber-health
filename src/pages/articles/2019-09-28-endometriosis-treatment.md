Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This **Part Four** of the series on Endometriosis. **(tag to TOC)**

<h2>What are the Treatment options?</h2>

Currently there is no cure or preventative treatment for endometriosis. There are several treatment options available that can help in disease management. Each treatment has its own benefits, limitations, and risks. Very few treatments actually target the disease, while many others only address the symptoms. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contemporary treatments</a> rely heavily upon surgical methods of lesion removal and medical strategies that suppress estrogen or menses. Due to the complexity of endometriosis and its symptoms, these strategies do not provide a suitable model of care for patients long term. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The current system’s inability to adequately address endometriosis pain symptoms often results in the emergence of broader functional sequela and psychological impact. The ability to address these broader impacts is crucial and certainly requires a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care.

Specialists agree that <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach</a> to care is necessary to address the many comorbidities and complexities of the disease. A multidisciplinary approach often means seeking out a variety of doctors and specialties to widen the scope of your care. Combining treatments, such as excision surgery, diet and nutrition, alternative therapies, and physical therapy, can lead to patients effectively managing the disease and their symptoms long term.  Patients will also need a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly individualized patient-focused approach</a> to care since no two patients have the same presentation of symptoms. It’s also imperative that the specialists communicate effectively with one another to truly bridge the gaps in their knowledge.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Patients with endometriosis often require individualized care over a long-term period, where priorities may change depending upon the type and severity of symptoms, the impact of these symptoms, current or future fertility goals and lifestyle factors. Individualized care benefits from a multi-disciplinary network of experts sufficiently skilled in providing advice on and treatment of endometriosis and its associated symptoms, based on the best available knowledge, their extensive experience and their transparent record of success rates.

Unfortunately, receiving long term care from a variety of specialists can become extremely costly making it inaccessible for many patients. Due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an antiquated approach</a> to managing complex chronic diseases, insurance policies do not cover complementary treatments and often healthcare providers do not offer them. For US patients,  ACOG, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, defines the standard of care for endometriosis and ultimately influences what treatments insurance companies will cover. Despite recent data points, patient outcry, and a pushback from specialists, <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2018/11/08/too-often-quality-of-life-for-endometriosis-patients-is-dictated-by-their-financial-resources/?fbclid=IwAR3QhTFx0Gt56Q2ZqS_PJTGm7KuHUpVOyLjojMJXhecodYFhanHB5RFmjaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACOG’s guidelines </a> remain ineffective and outdated and include palliative hormonal medications and ineffective surgeries such as hysterectomies. If ACOG were to recognize excision surgery and the multidisciplinary care approach, insurance companies would be compelled to provide coverage for treatments.
