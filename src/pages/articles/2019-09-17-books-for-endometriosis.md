Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers. 

If you'd like to learn more about endometriosis, please visit my **article**, [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This Part of my series, **Endometriosis** (tag to bottom table of contents)

<h2>Books for Endometriosis</h2>

This collection of books covers an array of topics on endometriosis, including diet, nutrition, surgery, disease management, holistic wellness, treatment options, and more. I've organized them according to their main focus but often there is an overlap in topics. I've provided reviews for the ones that I have read. I've included titles that I have not read but have received good reviews. When possible, read as many as you can to expand your understanding of this complex condition. You can use your local library to access many of these books for free. 

<h2>Books by Topic</h2>

<h3>Disease Overview</h3>

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endo-Patients-Survival-Guide-Endometriosis/dp/0984953515/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=endometriosis+book&qid=1568750801&sr=8-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Endo Patient’s Survival Guide: A Patient’s Guide to Endometriosis and Chronic Pelvic Pain</a> by Andrew S. Cook MD, FACOG- A patient’s companion to living with and overcoming endometriosis and pelvic pain: from seeking help and getting an initial diagnosis, to navigating treatment options, and achieving optimal relief and wellness.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beating-Endo-Holistic-Treatment-Endometriosis-ebook/dp/B07CL2R74T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beating Endo: How to Reclaim Your Life from Endometriosis</a> by Amy Stein DPT and Dr. Iris Kerin Orbuch- This informational, multidisciplinary approached book was written by leading endo specialists, Amy Stein PT, and Dr. Iris Orbuch. These healthcare professionals provide their clinical expertise through a whole mind/body approach, including diet, physical therapy, excision surgery, and mindfulness. 

  Personally, I found the bulk of information to align with endo specialists and current studies which makes it a useful resource. However, it does lack inclusive language, comes from a privileged perspective, and makes light of the serious side effects of hormonal contraceptives and birth control. Since there are so few comprehensive books on endo, I would recommend this but bear in mind its shortcomings. 
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Living-Well-Endometriosis-Doctor-Collins/dp/0060844264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Living Well with Endometriosis: What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You...That You Need to Know</a> by Kerry-Ann Morris- A complete guide to the side effects and treatments, both conventional and alternative, for endometriosis, from the founder of Unveiling Endometriosis Project who also has endometriosis.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Will-See-You-Endometriosis/dp/1681621126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Doctor Will See You Now: Recognizing and Treating Endometriosis</a> by Tamer Seckin MD.- This comprehensive text hopes to raise awareness among other physicians and among general readers, particularly patients who will now have the knowledge necessary to become powerful self advocates.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Googling-Endometriosis-centuries-David-Redwine/dp/1478321008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Googling Endometriosis: The Lost Centuries</a> by David B. Redwine, M.D.- Dr. Redwine is an internationally recognized as an expert in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of endometriosis. This comprehensive history of endometriosis spans from 1825 BC to 1899 AD, supplying an unsurpassed history which have not been previously investigated.

<h3>The Patient Perspective</h3>

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Me-About-My-Uterus/dp/1568585810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask Me About My Uterus: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women's Pain</a> by Abby Norman- Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women's bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It's time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition. She has dedicated her life to health activism and endometriosis awareness. 

  For me, this book read as a memoir, medical history, and disease overview. Few books show such honesty and clearly illustrate the insidious nature of endometriosis like Abby's. I would highly recommend her book for validation, information, and inspiration! 
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Private-Parts-Really-Live-Endometriosis/dp/1473687551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Private Parts: How To Really Live With Endometriosis</a> by Eleanor Thom- Part memoir, part guide book and part survival guide, Private Parts retraces the authors own journey with endometriosis, offering practical, down-to-earth and friendly advice covering everything from what actually happens in an internal exam to finding the right specialist for you.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alone-Crowd-Living-Well-Endometriosis/dp/0996148620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alone in the Crowd: Living Well with Endometriosis</a> by Ania G- Psychologist, Certified Holistic Heath Counselor, Endo patient, and Chernobyl survivor, Ania writes of her personal journey with endometriosis and how she developed various holistic and medical methods of dealing with the disease.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endometriosis-its-your-head-pelvis/dp/1732395144/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=endometriosis+book&qid=1568750801&sr=8-12-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVFZJSkpROEhaUlkzJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODAxMTcxMTNCV1haSFZHOFIwSCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODgwMDM0MUlPOFBQRTVLTVQwUSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Endometriosis: It's Not in Your Head, It's in Your Pelvis</a> by Bethany Stahl- Bethany shares her insights into navigating healthcare, choosing a doctor, and being chronically ill with endometriosis.

<h3>Surgery</h3> 

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Living-Endometriosis-Complete-Symptoms-Treatment-ebook/dp/B074DH9DK6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living with Endometriosis: The Complete Guide to Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Treatment Options</a>
[Stop Endometriosis and Pelvic Pain: What Every Woman and Her Doctor Need to Know](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Endometriosis-Pelvic-Pain-Doctor/dp/0984953574) by Andrew S. Cook MD and Robert Franklin MD- This book provides extensive information about the realities and the myths of endometriosis and pelvic pain. Dr. Cook explains why so many patients are misunderstood and misdiagnosed, why most endometriosis surgery is done so poorly, the principles and correct techniques for effective endometriosis surgery, and how to find the best doctors and healthcare providers. This does not use inclusive language. 

  Personally, this is the book I wish I had read before surgery.  Unfortunately, my surgeon had no patience or intentions of informing me on my options. This is the essential information you should be given before surgery but most likely won't. While I believe in the validity of a nonsurgical approach, this is a must read for those considering surgery. I would highly recommend this book. 

<h3>Nutrition and Diet</h3>

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endometriosis-Key-Healing-Through-Nutrition/dp/0007133103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Endometriosis: A Key to Healing Through Nutrition</a> by Dian Shepperson Mills and Michael Vernon-Drawing upon years of research, the authors show how the right diet can provide the key to optimum health in overcoming endometriosis.  Included is an explanation of how endometriosis affects the body, advice on how to cope with it, an account of the key role played by nutritious and healthy food, and information on foods that are harmful and foods with healing qualities. 

  This does not use inclusive language. Since most doctors are not well versed in the importance of diet and nutrition, I found this book essential in understanding the connection between disease and diet. At times it can be a dense read since it details the science behind the methods and provides an in depth look at endometriosis. I would highly recommend this book.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endometriosis-Health-Diet-Program-Your/dp/077880562X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Endometriosis Health and Diet Program: Get Your Life Back</a> by Andrew Cook MD FACOG and Danielle Cook MS RD CDE- This will dispel the myths surrounding endometriosis and provide scientifically based recommendations that are easy to understand and follow. It offers recommendations on treating root causes rather than just symptoms.

Keep tabs on your progress with a symptom tracker, and discover lifestyle adjustments that could further reduce your endometriosis symptoms.

<h3>Hormonal Health and Hormonal Contraceptives</h3>

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Pill-Program-Hormones-Dangerous-ebook/dp/B07BDFLWDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond the Pill: A 30-Day Program to Balance Your Hormones, Reclaim Your Body, and Reverse the Dangerous Side Effects of the Birth Control Pill</a> by Dr. Jolene Brighten- This book brings together up to date research, relevant science, and clinical expertise to create one of the most informative reads on hormones and hormonal contraceptives. While the birth control pill is widely prescribed as a quick-fix solution to a variety of women’s health conditions, taking it can also result in other more serious and dangerous health consequences. 

  Personally, this book was a savior for my hormonal literacy and health. Many readers, including myself, have called it the hormone bible because it's one of the most informative books on the subject. Before you begin any hormonal treatments read this book! I highly, highly recommend! This is one of my top recommendations.

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Period-Repair-Manual-Second-Treatment-ebook/dp/B075NDJC2J" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Period Repair Manual: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods</a> by Dr. Lara Briden- Written by a naturopathic doctor with more than twenty years experience, this book is a compilation of everything that works for hormonal health.

This provided a good, basic overview and I would recommend this book.

<h3>Gender and Racial Bias in Medicine</h3>

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Me-About-My-Uterus/dp/1568585810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask Me About My Uterus: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women's Pain</a> by Abby Norman- Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women's bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It's time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition. She has dedicated her life to health activism and endometriosis awareness.

Offering a clear explanation of the root causes of this insidious and entrenched bias and laying out its sometimes catastrophic consequences, this is a rallying wake up call that will change the way we look at health care for women. 

  Personally, this book was as riveting as it was harrowing. The substantial evidence of medical neglect, abuse, and bias is truly sickening and maddening. Having experienced varying types of these abuses first hand, it felt validating to hear others' stories. I wish this book was required reading for doctors. I would highly recommend! This is one of my top recommendations.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Serious-Navigate-Relationships-Pressure/dp/0807023957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invisible: How Young Women with Serious Health Issues Navigate Work, Relationships, and the Pressure to Seem Just Fine</a> by Michele Lent Hirsch- Though young women with serious illness tend to be seen as outliers, young female patients are in fact the primary demographic for many illnesses. They are also one of the most ignored groups in our medical system, a system where young women, especially women of color and trans women, are invisible. 

  Personally, this book made me feel validated and confirmed that my experiences with medical neglect and abuse were not a failing of my own. This book balances the riveting autobiography of a chronically ill person with a historical overview of medical abuse and neglect. While this doesn't focus on endo specifically, this is a favorite of mine, extremely relevant, and I would highly recommend.   This is one of my top recommendations.
