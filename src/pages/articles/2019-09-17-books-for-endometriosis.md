Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This article and site are dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers. 

If you'd like to learn more about endometriosis, please visit my article, **Endometriosis 101 (add link)**.

> Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue located outside the womb. These fragments are different structurally, and behave differently, from the normal endometrium which is shed during a period. With endometriosis, the disease commonly occurs on the pelvic structures (and sometimes beyond), causing severe pain, bowel, bladder or other organ dysfunction, inflammation, scarring and adhesions, and in some cases, infertility. Endometriosis represents a significant clinical challenge commonly associated with reduced quality of life in those affected. Symptoms are frequently wide-ranging and often start early in life, but may be underappreciated by medical and lay communities alike.

Below is a list of books on endometriosis. These books cover an array of topics on endometriosis, including diet, nutrition, surgery, disease management, holistic wellness, and more. I've organized them according to their main focus but often there is overlap in topics. I've provided reviews for the ones that I have read. I've included titles that I have not read but have received good reviews. When possible, read as many as you can to expand your understanding of this complex condition. You can use your local library to access these books for free. Libraries often have these titles as physical books or ebooks.

## Books

**Disease Overview**

* ****[Beating Endo: How to Reclaim Your Life from Endometriosis](https://www.amazon.com/Beating-Endo-Holistic-Treatment-Endometriosis-ebook/dp/B07CL2R74T) by Amy Stein DPT and Dr Iris Kerin Orbuch- This informational, multidisciplinary approached book was written by leading endo specialists, Amy Stein PT, and Dr. Iris Orbuch. These healthcare professionals provide their clinical expertise through a whole mind/body approach, including diet, physical therapy, excision surgery, and mindfulness. Personally, I found the bulk of information to align with endo specialists and current studies which makes it a very valuable resource. However, It does lack inclusive language, comes from a privileged perspective, and makes light of the serious side effects of hormonal contraceptives and birth control. I would recommend this since there are so few comprehensive books on endo but bear in mind its major shortcomings.
