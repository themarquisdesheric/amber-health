Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This article and site are dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers. 

If you'd like to learn more about endometriosis, please visit my article, **Endometriosis 101 (add link)**.

> Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue located outside the womb. These fragments are different structurally, and behave differently, from the normal endometrium which is shed during a period. With endometriosis, the disease commonly occurs on the pelvic structures (and sometimes beyond), causing severe pain, bowel, bladder or other organ dysfunction, inflammation, scarring and adhesions, and in some cases, infertility. Endometriosis represents a significant clinical challenge commonly associated with reduced quality of life in those affected. Symptoms are frequently wide-ranging and often start early in life, but may be underappreciated by medical and lay communities alike.

Below is a list of books on endometriosis. These books cover an array of topics on endometriosis, including diet, nutrition, surgery, disease management, holistic wellness, and more. I've organized them according to their main focus but often there is an overlap in topics. I've provided reviews for the ones that I have read. I've included titles that I have not read but have received good reviews. When possible, read as many as you can to expand your understanding of this complex condition. You can use your local library to access these books for free. Libraries often have these titles as physical books or ebooks.

## Books by Topic

**Disease Overview**

* [Beating Endo: How to Reclaim Your Life from Endometriosis](https://www.amazon.com/Beating-Endo-Holistic-Treatment-Endometriosis-ebook/dp/B07CL2R74T) by Amy Stein DPT and Dr. Iris Kerin Orbuch- This informational, multidisciplinary approached book was written by leading endo specialists, Amy Stein PT, and Dr. Iris Orbuch. These healthcare professionals provide their clinical expertise through a whole mind/body approach, including diet, physical therapy, excision surgery, and mindfulness. Personally, I found the bulk of information to align with endo specialists and current studies which makes it a useful resource. However, it does lack inclusive language, comes from a privileged perspective, and makes light of the serious side effects of hormonal contraceptives and birth control. Since there are so few comprehensive books on endo, I would recommend this but bear in mind its major shortcomings. 
* [The Endo Patient’s Survival Guide: A Patient’s Guide to Endometriosis & Chronic Pelvic Pain ](https://www.amazon.com/Endo-Patients-Survival-Guide-Endometriosis/dp/0984953515/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=endometriosis+book&qid=1568750801&sr=8-18)by Andrew S. Cook MD, FACOG- A patient’s companion to living with and overcoming endometriosis and pelvic pain: from seeking help and getting an initial diagnosis, to navigating treatment options, and achieving optimal relief and wellness.

* [Ask Me About My Uterus: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women's Pain](https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Me-About-My-Uterus/dp/1568585810) by Abby Norman- Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women's bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It's time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition. She has dedicated her life to health activism and endometriosis awareness. For me, this book read as a memoir, medical history, and disease overview. Few books show such honesty and the far reaching tentacles of endometriosis like Abby's. I would highly recommend her book for validation, information, and inspiration! 
* [Private Parts: How To Really Live With Endometriosis](https://www.amazon.com/Private-Parts-Really-Live-Endometriosis/dp/1473687551) by Eleanor Thom- Part memoir, part guide book and part survival guide, Private Parts retraces the authors own journey with endometriosis, offering practical, down-to-earth and friendly advice covering everything from what actually happens in an internal exam to finding the right specialist for you.

* [Endometriosis: it's not in your head, it's in your pelvis](https://www.amazon.com/Endometriosis-its-your-head-pelvis/dp/1732395144/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=endometriosis+book&qid=1568750801&sr=8-12-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVFZJSkpROEhaUlkzJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODAxMTcxMTNCV1haSFZHOFIwSCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODgwMDM0MUlPOFBQRTVLTVQwUSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) by Bethany Stahl- Bethany shares her insights into navigating healthcare, choosing a doctor, and being chronically ill with endometriosis.

**Surgery** 

* [Stop Endometriosis and Pelvic Pain: What Every Woman and Her Doctor Need to Know](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Endometriosis-Pelvic-Pain-Doctor/dp/0984953574) by Andrew S. Cook MD and Robert Franklin MD- This book provides extensive information about the realities and the myths of endometriosis and pelvic pain. Dr. Cook explains why so many patients are misunderstood and misdiagnosed, why most endometriosis surgery is done so poorly, the principles and correct techniques for effective endometriosis surgery, and how to find the best doctors and healthcare providers. Personally, this is the book I wish I had read before surgery.  Unfortunately, my surgeon had no patience or intentions of informing me on my options. This is the essential information you should be given before surgery but most likely won't. While I believe in the validity of a nonsurgical approach, this is a must read for those considering surgery. I would highly recommend this book. 

**Nutrition and Diet**

* [Endometriosis: A Key to Healing Through Nutrition](https://www.amazon.com/Endometriosis-Key-Healing-Through-Nutrition/dp/0007133103) by Dian Shepperson Mills and Michael Vernon-Drawing upon years of research, the authors show how the right diet can provide the key to optimum health in overcoming endometriosis.  Included is an explanation of how endometriosis affects the body, advice on how to cope with it, an account of the key role played by nutritious and healthy food, and information on foods that are harmful and foods with healing qualities. Since most doctors are not well versed in the importance of diet and nutrition, I found this book essential in understanding the connection between disease and diet. At times it can be a dense read since it details the science behind the methods and provides an in depth look at endometriosis. I would highly recommend this book.
* [The Endometriosis Health and Diet Program: Get Your Life Back](https://www.amazon.com/Endometriosis-Health-Diet-Program-Your/dp/077880562X) by Andrew Cook MD FACOG and Danielle Cook MS RD CDE- This will dispel the myths surrounding endometriosis and provide scientifically based recommendations that are easy to understand and follow.

She keeps it simple and, most importantly, delicious with 100 allergy friendly recipes. Personally, I found this cookbook a helpful starting point with fairly simple recipes. Some ingredients will not be suitable for all patients but it can help introduce you to plant based eating. I would recommend this book.
* [Whole New You: How Real Food Transforms Your Life, for a Healthier, More Gorgeous You: A Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Whole-New-You-Transforms-Healthier/dp/1101967358) by Tia Mowry- This cookbook draws on the latest research on whole plant foods, inflammation, and gut flora, to create a diet that can reduce pain and symptoms of endometriosis.

While the birth control pill is widely prescribed as a quick-fix solution to a variety of women’s health conditions, taking it can also result in other more serious and dangerous health consequences.

How to come off hormonal birth control, what your period should be like, how to talk to your doctor, and treatment protocols for all common period problems, including endometriosis. Personally, this book was a savior for my hormonal literacy and health. This has a wealth of information that most doctors don't. Her dedication to women's health and health advocacy are apparent. Before you begin any hormonal treatments read this book! I highly, highly recommend! This is one of my top recommendations.

This book offers a stretching, muscle-strengthening, and massage program, guidelines on foods, suggestions for stress, and pain reducing treatments. Personally, this book brought me closer to understanding and treating the complex relationship that the pelvic floor plays in endometriosis and pelvic pain. For those who cannot access or afford physical therapy options, this provides clinically based programs for exercises and nutrition that aligned with what I learned in physical therapy. This provided a good, basic overview and I would recommend this book.
* [Ending Female Pain, A Woman's Manual: The Ultimate Self-Help Guide for Women Suffering From Chronic Pelvic and Sexual Pain](https://www.amazon.com/Ending-Female-Womans-Manual-Expanded/dp/0615988636) by Isa Herrara MSPT- The quintessential self-help book for patients suffering from chronic pelvic and sexual pain.

**Politics and Gender and Racial Bias**

* [Ask Me About My Uterus: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women's Pain](https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Me-About-My-Uterus/dp/1568585810) by Abby Norman- Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women's bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It's time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition. She has dedicated her life to health activism and endometriosis awareness. For me, this book read as a memoir, medical history, and disease overview. Few books show such honesty and the far reaching tentacles of endometriosis like Abby's. I would highly recommend her book for validation, information, and inspiration! This is one of my top recommendations.
* [Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Harm-Medicine-Dismissed-Misdiagnosed/dp/0062470809) by Maya Dusenbery- An eye opening read for patients and health care providers alike, this shows how women suffer because the medical community knows relatively less about their diseases and bodies and too often doesn’t trust their reports of their symptoms. Offering a clear explanation of the root causes of this insidious and entrenched bias and laying out its sometimes catastrophic consequences, this is a rallying wake up call that will change the way we look at health care for women. Personally, this book was as riveting as it was harrowing. The substantial evidence of medical neglect, abuse, and bias is truly sickening and maddening. Having experienced varying types of these abuses first hand, it felt validating to hear others' stories. I wish this book was required reading for doctors. I would highly recommend! This is one of my top recommendations.
* [Invisible: How Young Women with Serious Health Issues Navigate Work, Relationships, and the Pressure to Seem Just Fine](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Serious-Navigate-Relationships-Pressure/dp/0807023957) by Michele Lent Hirsch- Though young women with serious illness tend to be seen as outliers, young female patients are in fact the primary demographic for many illnesses. They are also one of the most ignored groups in our medical system, a system where young women, especially women of color and trans women, are invisible. Personally, this book made me feel validated and confirmed that my experiences with  medical neglect and abuse were not a failing of my own.  This book balances the riveting autobiography of a chronically ill person with a historical overview of medical abuse and neglect. While this doesn't focus on endo specifically, this is a favorite of mine, extremely relevant, and I would highly recommend.   This is one of my top recommendations.
* [Sick: A Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Sick-Memoir-Porochista-Khakpour/dp/006242873X) Paperback by Porochista Khakpour- This is a grueling, emotional journey as a woman, an Iranian-American, a writer, and a lifelong sufferer of undiagnosed health problems, in which she examines her subsequent struggles with mental illness and her addiction to doctor prescribed benzodiazepines.
