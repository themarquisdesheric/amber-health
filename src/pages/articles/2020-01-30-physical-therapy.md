<h2>Physical Therapy</h2>

Specialists agree that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complementary treatments</a> may help to reduce the patient's pain from endometriosis and provide additional health benefits. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIVCGwNYAQfzW1ULc4CIEtxeN2eAVOjv/view?fbclid=IwAR0C80P8GY_oUzcNUPBERyXbL8I71LRXYSwUp6Zl3YzCfEUCype56z9c0Cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelvic floor physical therapy</a> is a specialty of physical therapy that focuses on the pelvis and surrounding affected areas. This includes working on the muscles, bones, ligaments, and fascia in the core, hips, back, legs, and pelvis. Physical therapy to address endometriosis-related pain has shown promise in initial studies. In one study, participants experienced significant improvements in all domains of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.5301/JE.2012.9088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual function, including pain, desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction</a>. The specific manual therapy used is thought to deform or cause the failure of adhesive bonds. As a result, pain decreases and mobility appears to improve. Since few studies have been conducted, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 

<blockquote>Although future research is needed, this therapy, designed to increase function and reduce pain by restoring soft tissue, visceral and osseous mobility, is a non-pharmaceutical, non-surgical technique that has produced few adverse effects or complications. As such, it offers a promising alternative to physicians, clinicians, and others involved in women’s health.

The pelvic floor muscles function as a support for the pelvic organs and make up part of the urethra, rectum, and vagina. These muscles allow for sexual intercourse and the normal functioning of bladder and bowel. When the muscles are too relaxed or too tight, it is called <a href="http://centerforendo.com/the-significance-of-pelvic-floor-muscle-dysfunction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, or PFD</a>. PFD is closely associated with endometriosis, Interstitial Cystitis, and Chronic Pelvic Pain.

Chronic Pelvic Pain and Interstitial Cystitis, or painful bladder syndrome, are common comorbidities of endometriosis. Studies on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18304280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pelvic floor physical therapy</a> for these two conditions have shown promise. Pelvic floor physical therapy addresses musculoskeletal components that are involved in pelvic and genital pain syndromes and sexual dysfunction. Physical therapy treatments include manual therapy, electrical stimulation modalities, self-care education, stress management, and biofeedback. 

<h3>To Kegel or Not?</h3>

 While <a href="http://centerforendo.com/the-significance-of-pelvic-floor-muscle-dysfunction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kegel exercises</a> are commonly suggested for strengthening the pelvic floor, they may not be suitable for patients with PFD. During a kegel, the pelvic floor muscles are contracted. In PFD, the pelvic floor muscles may be hypertonic, or too tense, so this would not be appropriate. The most suitable exercises for your particular case are decided after you have been thoroughly evaluated by a physical therapist.

<blockquote>Physical therapy treatment of pelvic pain is an integral component of the multidisciplinary approach to Chronic Pelvic Pain and associated sexual dysfunction.
