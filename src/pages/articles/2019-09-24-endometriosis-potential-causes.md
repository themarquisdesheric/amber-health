Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers. 

If you'd like to learn more about endometriosis, please visit my article, [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

<h2>What are the Potential Causes?</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote">

Often called a 'disease of theories,' the definitive cause(s) of endometriosis remain under debate, though a demonstrated association with a number of hereditary, environmental, epigenetic, and menstrual characteristics exist. No single researcher has found 'the' answer. <cite>

The etiology of endometriosis is complex and not completely understood. There are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278996/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general theories</a> on the cause of disease but each has its limitations. No theory is adequate in describing the many factors that contribute to endo’s manifestation and behaviors. No single theory can explain endometriosis in all patients, especially cis men and in extrapelvic manifestions. 

A possible explanation is that individuals are born with <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple mechanisms </a> that combine overtime to create the perfect environment for triggering the disease. It’s also possible that the pain and symptoms are due to a variety of comorbid conditions such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and environmental sensitivities. 

Since there are many theories in circulation, this article examines several of the current ones for a better understanding of the possible cause(s) of endometriosis.

<h3>Etiology Theories</h3>

**Retrograde Menstruation**

This century-old theory of <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retrograde menstruation </a> remains one of the most popular theories despite its proven flaws. In 1927, Dr. Sampson proposed the disease resulted from a reversal in menstruation in which the endometrium is deposited and implanted outside of the uterus. The endometrium is not the same as endometriosis lesions so this does not offer an explanation. Also, retrograde menstruation is very common and does not cause endometriosis in a majority of menstruators. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12372441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple studies</a> have demonstrated that retrograde menstruation does not account for pathogenesis, or disease development. Sadly this myth rules much of modern thinking and delays further disease management efforts. 

**Immunologic Dysfunction**

It’s thought that a dysfunctional immune system may allow for implantation of menstrual debris but this does not sufficiently explain the initial disease process. Endometriosis shares <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22330229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">similarities</a> with several autoimmune diseases including elevated levels of cytokines, decreased apoptosis, and cell-mediated abnormalities. Research is still needed to determine whether it is an autoimmune disease. Some <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specialists</a> believe that it may be share an underlying pathology with several autoimmune disorders.

**Stem Cells**

The <a href="https://www.endofound.org/stem-cell-theory-of-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stem cell theory</a> suggests that specific stem cells play a large part in the development of endometriosis and regeneration of the endometrium. Stem cells may spread to regions outside the uterus where they regenerate and spread further. Even in the absence of menstruation, <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stems cells</a>  have been shown to populate lesions, or areas of endometriosis tissue. This might explain the rare cases of cis male endometriosis but more research is needed. 

**Genetics**

Genetics may play a role in developing endometriosis. There is a <a href="https://www.endocenter.org/do-you-have-endo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 to 10 fold risk</a> in those whose mother or relative has disease.

**Environmental Toxins**

Environmental pollutants or toxins are hypothesized to cause changes to cells that alter cytokines, immune system, endocrine system, and growth factors which could promote endometriosis. Chemicals like <a href="https://drbrighten.com/causes-endometriosis-5-natural-treatment-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dioxins and  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)</a> have been considered to increase this risk but further research is needed to be certain. Research studies <a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/sites/default/files/files/Information/Understanding-endometriosis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> have shown that animals develop endometriosis when exposed to high levels of dioxin but this has not been proven in humans. 

**Halban’s Theory of Lymphatic Spread**

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278996/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halban’s Theory</a> hypothesizes that endometriosis travels throughout the lymphatic or vascular systems. This theory explains rare endometriotic lesions in the brain or lung, but does not explain the location of most endometriosis which most commonly occurs in the gravitationally dependent parts of the pelvis. 

**Meyer’s Theory of Metaplasia**

<a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/sites/default/files/files/Information/Understanding-endometriosis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meyer’s Theory</a> believes metaplasia or  the abnormal change in the nature of a tissue may explain endometriosis. Metaplasia commonly occurs as a response to inflammation. The process allows for cells to alter themselves to adapt better to their environment. This may explain the appearance of endometriosis on the lungs and skin and in women with no womb. While this theory seems logical,  it has been difficult to support <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278996/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scientifically</a>.

**Homeobox Genes** 

Homeobox genes or HOX genes play a fundamental role in the shaping of the organism during embryonic development. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4691806/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HOX gene mutations</a> and alterations to the normal HOX gene expression patterns cause developmental abnormalities in the reproductive tract. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10325287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies</a> have shown abnormal HOX gene expression in patients with endometriosis. This dysfunctional expression may result in abnormal cell behavior  that causes the disease later on. Dr. David Redwine, a leading researcher and excision specialist, suggested an <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embryologic origin</a> some 30 years ago due to the presence of endometriosis in fetuses. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">
Without question, there are various additional factors that contribute to disease pathophysiology and pathogenesis. Propagation of outdated myths and misinformation, and the continued research positioning of endometriosis as normal endometrium, keeps the disease mired in outdated concepts, hysterectomy, failed drug therapy, and incomplete treatment.

In conclusion, there is no single theory that is entirely adequate in describing the disease origin, process, locations, and behaviors. Researchers and specialists speculate that it likely takes a variety of factors described in each theory to cause endometriosis.
