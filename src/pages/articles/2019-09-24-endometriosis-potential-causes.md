Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

<h2>What are the Potential Causes?</h2>

<blockquote>

Often called a 'disease of theories,' the definitive cause(s) of endometriosis remain under debate, though a demonstrated association with a number of hereditary, environmental, epigenetic, and menstrual characteristics exist. No single researcher has found 'the' answer. <cite>

The etiology of endometriosis is complex and not completely understood. There are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278996/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general theories</a> on the cause of disease but each has its limitations. No theory is adequate in describing the many factors that contribute to endo’s manifestation and behaviors. No single theory can explain endometriosis in all patients, especially cis men and in extrapelvic manifestions. 

A possible explanation is that individuals are born with <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple mechanisms </a> that combine overtime to create the perfect environment for triggering the disease. It’s also possible that the pain and symptoms are due to a variety of comorbid conditions such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and environmental sensitivities. 

Since there are many theories in circulation, this article examines several of the current ones for a better understanding of the possible cause(s) of endometriosis.

Etiology Theories

Retrograde menstruation

This century-old theory of retrograde menstruation remains of the most popular theories despite its proven flaws. In 1927, Dr. Sampson proposed the disease resulted from a reversal in menstruation in which the endometrium is deposited and implanted outside of the uterus. The endometrium is not the same as endometriosis lesions so this does not offer an explanation. Also, retrograde menstruation is very common and does not cause endometriosis in a majority of menstruators. Multiple studies have demonstrated that retrograde menstruation does not account for pathogenesis, or disease development. Sadly this myth rules much of modern thinking and delays further disease management efforts.
