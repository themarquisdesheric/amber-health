## What are the Potential Causes?

> Often called a 'disease of theories,' the definitive cause(s) of endometriosis remain under debate, though demonstrated association with a number of hereditary, environmental, epigenetic and menstrual characteristics exist. _No single researcher has found 'the' answer._ The chronic, inflammatory reaction, infertility and pain associated with endometriosis may also correspond to a variety of co-morbid conditions ranging from autoimmune disease to food and environmental allergies and intolerances. Theories include:
>
> * Retrograde menstruation– Sampson’s century-old theory of abnormal backflow; this does _not_ explain pathogenesis
> * Immunologic dysfunction– a 'broken' immune system allows for implantation of menstrual debris
> * Stem Cells– have been demonstrated to populate lesions, even in absence of menstruation
> * Genetics– a 7-10 fold risk exists in those whose mother or relative has disease
> * Environmental Toxins– can cause cell changes which allow for implantation and errant immune response
>
> No single theory explains endometriosis in all patients, particularly in (cis) males with endometriosis and extrapelvic forms of the disease. Likely, we are born with mechanisms which, when later combined – 'the perfect storm' – trigger the disease.

Dr. Dan C Martin's paper, [Endometriosis Concepts and Theories](https://www.danmartinmd.com/files/endotheory.pdf), reviews over 200 articles on endometriosis. Dr. Martin found,

> No concept or theory is entirely adequate. It takes eighteen to introduce what I have seen published and many more to discuss what I have read.
