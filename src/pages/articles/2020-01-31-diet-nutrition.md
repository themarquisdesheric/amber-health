<h2>How Can Diet and Nutrition Affect Endometriosis?</h2> 

Diet and nutrition have become areas of increased interest for potential disease management and prevention. Dietary modification and nutrition therapy may provide various benefits as a complementary therapy for treating endometriosis. Several studies have shown <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/19/8/1755/2356458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a potential link</a> between endometriosis and diet. It's important to note that more research is needed to understand <a href="https://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(13)00007-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the role that diet</a> may play in endometriosis and its symptoms. Based on the available information, several diet recommendations for endometriosis have been developed. 

<blockquote>Dietary modification as a complementary approach and a short-term recourse to reduce the effects of inflammation associated with endometriosis is feasible, practical, and can be monitored under physician supervision. Nevertheless, due in part to the complex nature of the condition and the lack of reliable markers to detect disease initiation, scientific-based data are currently deficient to support the ability of anti-inflammatory foods and food components to prevent endometriosis.

<h3>Anti-Inflammatory Diet</h3>

In studies, diet has been shown to have a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0884533610385703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modest effect on inflammatory markers</a> that contribute to many modern diseases. Since inflammation contributes to endometriosis and pain symptoms, an <a href="https://www.slucare.edu/ob-gyn/center-for-endometriosis/endometriosis-diet-booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-inflammatory diet</a> has been recommended by specialists. An anti-inflammatory diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, plant-based foods, beans, and spices. Foods rich in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324729920_Diet_and_endometriosis-revisiting_the_linkages_to_inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omega-3 fatty acids</a> have shown anti-inflammatory effects that may be beneficial in reducing the chronic inflammation promoted by endometriosis. Fish oil, fatty fish, seeds, and walnuts are a few examples of Omega-3 rich foods.

On the other hand, diets rich in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873173/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trans fats</a> may increase the risk of endometriosis. Unlike the anti-inflammatory effects of Omega-3 fatty acids, trans fats promote inflammation. Trans fats are found in fast food, processed foods, fried foods, vegetable shortening, and baked goods. A reduction or total removal of trans fats has been suggested for endometriosis patients.

<blockquote>The results of this study suggest that increasing long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake and decreasing trans-unsaturated fatty acid intake may be the first identified modifiable risk factors for endometriosis. In addition, this evidence provides another disease association that supports efforts to remove trans-unsaturated fats from the food supply.

Some researchers believe the origin and progression of endometriosis may be linked to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324729920_Diet_and_endometriosis-revisiting_the_linkages_to_inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diets that are deficient</a> in necessary nutrients. The resulting changes are thought to promote epigenetic abnormalities that could trigger disease. In turn, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may have an ability to protect against or regress endometriosis. <a href="https://www.slucare.edu/ob-gyn/center-for-endometriosis/endometriosis-diet-booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organic produce</a> is recommended to reduce your exposure to pesticides which can negatively alter hormonal pathways or decrease the antioxidant capacity of the plants. 

<h3>Red Meat</h3>

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330594/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red meat consumption</a> and its impact on endometriosis risk and progression is another topic of interest in research. A commonly referenced <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(18)30444-7/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> concluded there was an increased risk of endometriosis associated with a high intake of red meat, such as ham and beef. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254009?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other studies</a> have also resulted in the same association of risk and increased red meat consumption. However, there exists conflicting data from a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875189?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> that showed no association. Red meat is also thought to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330594/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise estrogen and inflammation</a> which contributes to endometriosis growth. Many specialists recommend a mainly plant based diet. If consuming red meat, <a href="https://www.slucare.edu/ob-gyn/center-for-endometriosis/endometriosis-diet-booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">organic, grass fed beef</a> is recommended in small amounts.

<blockquote>Diets deficient in nutrients result in changes in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and promote epigenetic abnormalities, that may be involved in the genesis and progression of the disease. Foods rich in omega 3 with anti-inflammatory effects, supplementation with N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D and resveratrol, in addition to the increased consumption of fruits, vegetables (preferably organic) and whole grains exert a protective effect, reducing the risk of development and possible regression of disease. Dietary re-education seems to be a promising tool in the prevention and treatment of endometriosis.

<h3>Phytoestrogens and Xenoestrogens</h3>

Estrogen is thought to contribute to disease progression in endometriosis. Estrogen stimulates endometriosis growth so some researchers suggest reducing the consumption of foods with an estrogenic effect, or the ability to raise internal estrogen levels. These foods contain <a href="https://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(13)00007-2/fulltext#s0120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phytoestrogens</a>, which are plant derived compounds that have an estrogenic effect on the endocrine system. Examples of phytoestrogens include soy, flaxseeds, some grains, and legumes. However, this <a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2007/05000/Effect_of_Soy_Isoflavones_on_Endometriosis_.19.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that an increased consumption of soybeans was associated with a reduced risk of advanced endometriosis. Researchers theorize that phytoestrogens may actually have the ability to block the effects of estrogen rather than increase it. Due to conflicting data, more research is needed to clarify which approach is beneficial for endometriosis. 

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10866031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xenoestrogens</a> are chemicals that mimic bad estrogen. Like phytoestrogens, they may act like estrogen internally and could interfere with the actions of endogenous estrogens. Xenoestrogens are commonly found in our environment. They can be found in plastic, pesticides, parabens, commercial food products, children’s toys, and more. Since non-organic produce has high levels of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pesticides</a> organic produce has been recommended. Patients should avoid these products to reduce their exposures.

<h3>Gluten</h3>

Gluten may play a role in endometriosis symptoms and pain. Several studies have found that following a <a href="https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/gluten-and-endometriosis-is-there-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gluten-free diet</a> can lead to a reduction in symptoms and improvements in quality of life for endometriosis patients. 75 percent of the women who took part in the study reported a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decrease in painful symptoms</a> after following a gluten-free diet for 12 months. A considerable increase in physical functioning, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, and mental health was also observed in all patients. Endometriosis is known to have a variety of comorbidities and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/10/2896/611791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celiac disease</a> may be one. In research, endometriosis seems to be associated with prior Celiac Disease. Potential explanations might be shared etiological factors and inflammation from Celiac Disease. 

<h3>Elimination Diet</h3>

Each person with endometriosis has individual needs and food triggers. The Elimination Diet protocol is considered a useful method for identifying personal food triggers and creating an individualized diet plan based on the results. This endometriosis diet guide provides details and instructions for completing the <a href="https://www.slucare.edu/ob-gyn/center-for-endometriosis/endometriosis-diet-booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elimination Diet</a>.

While further research is needed to clarify the role of diet in disease, nutritional counseling and diet change have been shown to be a <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)01944-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost effective method to reduce pain</a> and improve the quality of life of patients with endometriosis. Patients self-report significant responses to dietary choices that can either trigger or relieve their symptoms. Dietary changes were among the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6332532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most highly rated self-management strategies</a> in a survey of endometriosis patients.

<blockquote>Nutritional counseling and therapy alongside orthodox medical treatments provides a cost effective method in the reduction of pain and improvements in the quality of life of patients with endometriosis.
