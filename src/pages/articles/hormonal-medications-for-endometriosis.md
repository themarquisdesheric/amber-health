<h3>What Hormonal Medications Are Available?</h3>

Many doctors use hormonal medications as a first-line treatment for endometriosis. Hormone medication can come in the form of oral contraceptives like birth control pills, progestin-only pills, progestin medicines, and GnRH agonists. While hormonal medications are the most commonly prescribed drugs for endometriosis, they have been shown to <a href="http://endopaedia.info/diagnosis12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not eradicate</a>, <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop progression</a>, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve the disease long-term</a>.

<blockquote>Medical therapy represents only a symptomatic treatment and not the definitive solution to endometriosis lesions that may persist despite different medications, dosages, and duration of the therapy.

</blockquote>

<h3>How Do They Work?</h3>

In theory, hormonal medication is thought to decrease endometriosis tissue activity by halting or suppressing menses. However, there are <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several problems</a> with this approach. Although suppressed, the endometriosis is still <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressing and growing deeper</a>. Since the disease was never removed, the endometriosis tissue will reactivate once suppression stops and <a href="https://www.thecrrs.com/endometriosis-excision-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms will return</a>. Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high recurrence rates</a> of disease are associated with all hormonal medications.

<blockquote>
The pill specifically suppresses hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and pituitary gonadotropin secretion. These are brain structures that control hormone production. The suppression of these hormones results in luteinizing hormone (LH) suppression. Without LH your ovaries don't get the signal to ovulate. So, no egg is released.

<cite><a href="https://drbrighten.com/how-do-birth-control-pills-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- How Do Birth Control Pills Work</a></cite>

</blockquote>

There is a myth, even amongst doctors, that hormonal medications are confined to and only work on the reproductive system. Hormonal medications, including birth control, <a href="https://drbrighten.com/how-do-birth-control-pills-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work on the brain level by suppressing brain structures</a> that control hormone production. The brain stops communicating with the ovaries and in turn the ovaries stop ovulating. You are no longer producing your normal cascade of hormones and synthetic hormones have replaced them. This is important because hormones control and impact functions throughout the entire body and each of these can be affected by synthetic hormones. This also dispels the myth that hormonal medications balance or fix your natural hormones. They do not have this ability. They can only <a href="https://drbrighten.com/how-do-birth-control-pills-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suppress, or shut them off</a>.  

<blockquote>
It’s important to understand that hormonal contraceptives deliver synthetic hormones to your system that impact every system and every cell of your body. Every cell of your body has receptors for these hormones and just like your natural hormones can elicit changes, so can these synthetic birth control hormones.

<h3>How Effective Are Hormonal Medications?</h3>

<blockquote>All medical therapy, whether administered as first-line treatment or postoperatively, is associated with high rates of disease recurrence.

Despite the proven ineffectiveness, many doctors continue to offer hormonal medication as an option for the treatment of endometriosis. Few are educated on the <a href="https://drbrighten.com/the-contraception-guide/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Happy+World+Contraception+Day%21&utm_campaign=Happy+World+Contraception+Day%21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risks, side effects, and limitations</a> of hormonal medication and as a result they cannot educate their patients accordingly. Too often patients are not informed that it can only provide <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptomatic relief</a>, while the disease will continue to progress, potentially worsening the initial problem. It is important to remember that hormonal medication cannot eradicate the disease,  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot improve fertility</a>, and has shown no effect on adhesions. 

<blockquote>In the general healthcare community including at the OB/GYN level, it is taught (and hence practiced) that the most frequent mainstays of treatment are medical suppressives and incomplete surgery. Medication does not eradicate endometriosis, however, and the disease does not simply ‘go away’ as a result of drug suppression. At best, such a course of therapy provides only a temporary means of symptom improvement, not definitive treatment. Often, side effects are significantly negative and intolerable, and may last far beyond the cessation of treatment. Poor outcomes on suppression therapies are routine: drug therapy that can destroy endometriosis permanently has yet to be discovered. Hormonal suppression has 'no effect on adhesion of endometriotic cells and cannot improve fertility'.

In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent review</a> of hormonal contraceptives used for endometriosis-related symptoms, certain ones were found to relieve some symptoms, such as pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, and dyspareunia. Due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insufficient evidence</a>, no definitive conclusions could be made about the overall superiority of any particular hormonal contraceptive. However, after a systemic review of the evidence, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supportive data was determined to be of low quality or insufficient</a> to reach conclusions on the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives for treating endometriosis symptoms. Further studies are needed to clarify what place, if any, hormonal contraceptives have in the management of endometriosis. 

<blockquote>Data indicate that little difference exists in effectiveness of the various analogs, all of which last only while the patient is undergoing treatment, and most of which have negative side effects.

After reviewing 16 trials, <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD003678/MENSTR_there-is-no-evidence-that-hormonal-suppression-either-before-or-after-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-associated-with-a-benefit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cochrane Library</a> found insufficient evidence to determine if there was a benefit from pre-surgical hormone medication. They also found there <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD003678/MENSTR_there-is-no-evidence-that-hormonal-suppression-either-before-or-after-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-associated-with-a-benefit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was no evidence of benefit</a> associated with post surgical  hormone medication.

<blockquote>The available literature suggests that Combined Hormonal Contraceptive (CHC) treatment is effective for relief of endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia; however, the supportive data are of low quality. Furthermore, insufficient data exist to reach conclusions about the overall superiority of any given CHC therapy, and the relative benefit in comparison to other approaches. Additional high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role of CHC agents and other treatments in patients with endometriosis-related pain.

<h3>What Are the Side Effects?</h3>

On the other hand, we do know that hormonal medications can cause intolerable and significant side effects including <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.020084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stroke</a>, <a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/45/2/165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crohn's disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1700732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain cancers</a>, including brain, breast, and liver cancer. Other side effects include <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27680324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depression</a>,  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2960241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an increased risk of cardiovascular disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.01041/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an impairment in the ability to recognize others’ emotional expressions</a>. Early research has shown that by altering the hormonal chemistry of the body with birth control it might <a href="https://drbrighten.com/can-birth-control-affect-who-youre-attracted-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> change users' behaviors and impact mate selection.</a> 
Studies have shown that it can lead to nutrient deficiencies, increase the risk of developing certain autoimmune diseases, and negatively impact your adrenal and thyroid health. 

Headache, persistent pain, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), life-threatening infection, blood clots, liver tumors, ovarian cysts, mood changes, weight gain, loss of scalp hair, and less sexual desire are potential side effects listed in the medical brochures for <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/021098s019lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yasmin</a>, <a href="https://labeling.bayerhealthcare.com/html/products/pi/Mirena_PI.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirena</a>,  <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020246s036lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Depo-Provera</a>, and <a href="https://www.nuvaring.com/risks-side-effects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NuvaRing</a>. This is not an exhaustive list of side effects. The amount of potential side effects of hormonal medications is staggering and varies greatly patient to patient. Side effects can last permanently or long after cessation of the medication. 

<h3>Orilissa (<i>elagolix</i>)</h3>

The newest hormonal drug, Orilissa, has received <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely negative reviews</a> from studies, experts, and <a href="http://www.fdable.com/basic_query/aers/7fa29a3fe647402fb0fdd36d2f64c00d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patients</a>. For example, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that there are limitations in the evidence <a href="https://icer-review.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ICER_Endometriosis_RAAG_080318.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> on the long-term safety and effectiveness</a> of elagolix for use in endometriosis patients. Further studies are needed to confirm if there is any benefit to using elagolix instead of the currently used hormonal medications. Additional studies are also needed to rule out any long-term safety risks for patients. <a href="https://icer-review.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ICER_Endometriosis_RAAG_080318.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Known risks of elagolix</a> include bone mineral density loss that is significantly greater than with no treatment, changes in blood lipid profiles that may put users at higher risk for cardiovascular events, suicidal ideation, and elevated liver function tests. Here is a <a href="http://www.fdable.com/basic_query/aers/7fa29a3fe647402fb0fdd36d2f64c00d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">searchable database</a> of FDA Adverse Event Cases for elagolix.

<blockquote>Evidence was not adequate to determine whether elagolix offers a net health benefit compared to no treatment, or compared to treatment with either a GnRH agonist (leuprorelin acetate) or a hormonal contraceptive (depot medroxyprogesterone), due to limited and mixed evidence on clinical effectiveness and potential risks. Since endometriosis-related symptoms recur after stopping treatment, it remains to be determined whether elagolix is safe or effective for long-term use.

<h3>Lupron</h3>

 GnRH antagonists such as, Zoladex, Lupron, and Diphereline are commonly used in endometriosis care. These medications were originally approved for treatment of advanced male prostate cancer. Lupron has a <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/georgia-woman-says-drug-used-to-treat-endometriosis-led-to-series-of-health-problems/859263892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial history</a> of significant and long-lasting <a href="https://www.rxlist.com/lupron-side-effects-drug-center.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">side effects</a>. There have been <a href="https://www.lupronvictimshub.com/lawsuits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous lawsuits</a> launched by patients who claim the drug is responsible for a wide range of <a href="https://www.jpagonline.org/article/S1083-3188(18)30090-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chronic symptoms</a>, including bone loss, memory loss, vision loss, and chronic pain.  Dr. Redwine has noted that Lupron <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIVCGwNYAQfzW1ULc4CIEtxeN2eAVOjv/view?fbclid=IwAR0C80P8GY_oUzcNUPBERyXbL8I71LRXYSwUp6Zl3YzCfEUCype56z9c0Cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not induce a normal state of menopause</a> and creates an unnaturally elevated FSH. 
 
 Lupron's creator, AbbVie has been reprimanded for not investigating <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/abbvie-responds-to-fda-criticism-over-manufacturing-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deaths</a> in association with several of its drugs, including Lupron. In 1999, the FDA received adverse drug reports about Lupron from 4,228 women, 325 of which required hospitalization and 25 of which died. Patients have filed <a href="http://www.fdable.com/basic_query/aers/81dd978d5a329b02fb95fcb4bafd485b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly 24,000 reports for adverse reactions</a> and thousands of deaths from Lupron to the FDA. The FDA deemed more than half of them serious cases and is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/questions-and-answers-fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers/january-march-2017-potential-signals-serious-risksnew-safety-information-identified-fda-adverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evaluating</a> them for regulatory actions.
