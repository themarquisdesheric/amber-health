<h2>What are Alternative and Complementary Therapies?</h2>

A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach</a> that is individualized to the patient’s needs will provide the most successful, long term outcome in endometriosis management. Often this involves receiving care from a variety of doctors and specialists to properly address a wide range of symptoms. This can include working with a gynecologist, nutritionist, integrative doctor, urologist, and many other types of healthcare providers. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108065/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> has shown several potential benefits to <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(15)00753-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complementary and alternative therapies</a> for endometriosis patients. Examples of complementary therapies include physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and meditation. These therapies use various methods to potentially <a href="http://www.endometriosis.co.uk/complementary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mitigate symptoms, reduce pain or stress, and aid disease management</a>. 

<blockquote>The majority of patients with chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis have additional related comorbidities. This preliminary data suggests that a thorough approach that addresses these additional processes that contribute to chronic pelvic pain may be a key factor in maintaining such re-operation rates lower than previously reported for patients with endometriosis.

At the Center for Endometriosis Research and Treatment of UC San Diego Health, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrative medicine</a> accounted for 43% of the referrals made outside of the core patient-gynecologist team. Physical therapy accounted for 11% of the referrals patients received. Specialists at this center recognize and stress the importance of a multidisciplinary program that reflects the individual needs and wishes of their patients. Again and again, specialists emphasis the importance of establishing a comprehensive approach that includes <a href="https://www.jogc.com/article/S1701-2163(20)30013-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speciality clinics</a>, which are solely dedicated to treating endometriosis and include complementary modalities. 

Using complementary and alternative medicine allows patients to make informed decisions about their health and to manage their chronic illness. Research has found chronically ill patients practice complementary and alternative medicines as a personal responsibility for their health and as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12231024?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a critical aspect of self care management</a>. Patients with endometriosis have turned to self management due to frustration at the lack of effective medical treatments. Self management may help patients with endometriosis <a href="https://bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2431-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel empowered and have a sense of agency</a>.

<blockquote>The findings confirm that complementary and alternative medicine use can be understood as a critical component of self-care management in general, and not as a rejection of conventional medicine or an unrealistic search for cure. In contrast, it represents personal responsibility for health, reframing the measures by which therapeutics are evaluated, and adopting a pragmatic approach to living as well as possible in the context of a chronic condition.

These complementary and alternative therapies have been recommended by specialists due to the potential benefit they may have for managing endometriosis and the related symptoms. This is not an exhaustive list of therapies. Since all endometriosis patients are different, these methods may not be suitable or successful for everyone.

<h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2> 

Diet and nutrition have become areas of increased interest for potential disease management and prevention. Dietary modification and nutrition therapy may provide various benefits as a complementary therapy for treating endometriosis. Several studies have shown <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/19/8/1755/2356458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a potential link</a> between endometriosis and diet. It's important to note that more research is needed to understand <a href="https://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(13)00007-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the role that diet</a> may play in endometriosis and its symptoms. Based on the available information, several diet recommendations for endometriosis have been developed. 

<blockquote>Dietary modification as a complementary approach and a short-term recourse to reduce the effects of inflammation associated with endometriosis is feasible, practical, and can be monitored under physician supervision. Nevertheless, due in part to the complex nature of the condition and the lack of reliable markers to detect disease initiation, scientific-based data are currently deficient to support the ability of anti-inflammatory foods and food components to prevent endometriosis.

<h3>Anti-Inflammatory Diet</h3>

In studies, diet has been shown to have a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0884533610385703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modest effect on inflammatory markers</a> that contribute to many modern diseases. Since inflammation contributes to endometriosis and pain symptoms, an <a href="http://obgyn.slu.edu/uploads/centerforendo/Combined%20Anti-Inflammatory%20and%20Elimination%20Diet%20for%20Adults%20Living%20with%20Endometriosis%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-inflammatory diet</a> has been recommended by specialists. An anti-inflammatory diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, plant-based foods, beans, and spices. Foods rich in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324729920_Diet_and_endometriosis-revisiting_the_linkages_to_inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omega-3 fatty acids</a> have shown anti-inflammatory effects that may be beneficial in reducing the chronic inflammation promoted by endometriosis. Fish oil, fatty fish, seeds, and walnuts are a few examples of Omega-3 rich foods.

On the other hand, diets rich in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873173/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trans fats</a> may increase the risk of endometriosis. Unlike the anti-inflammatory effects of Omega-3 fatty acids, trans fats promote inflammation. Trans fats are found in fast food, processed foods, fried foods, vegetable shortening, and baked goods. A reduction or total removal of trans fats has been suggested for endometriosis patients.

<blockquote>The results of this study suggest that increasing long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake and decreasing trans-unsaturated fatty acid intake may be the first identified modifiable risk factors for endometriosis. In addition, this evidence provides another disease association that supports efforts to remove trans-unsaturated fats from the food supply.

</blockquote>

Some researchers believe the origin and progression of endometriosis may be linked to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324729920_Diet_and_endometriosis-revisiting_the_linkages_to_inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diets that are deficient</a> in necessary nutrients. The resulting changes are thought to promote epigenetic abnormalities that could trigger disease. In turn, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may have an ability to protect against or regress endometriosis. <a href="http://obgyn.slu.edu/uploads/centerforendo/Combined%20Anti-Inflammatory%20and%20Elimination%20Diet%20for%20Adults%20Living%20with%20Endometriosis%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organic produce</a> is recommended to reduce your exposure to pesticides which can negatively alter hormonal pathways or decrease the antioxidant capacity of the plants. 

<h3>Red Meat</h3>

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330594/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red meat consumption</a> and its impact on endometriosis risk and progression is another topic of interest in research. A commonly referenced <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(18)30444-7/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> concluded there was an increased risk of endometriosis associated with a high intake of red meat, such as ham and beef. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254009?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other studies</a> have also resulted in the same association of risk and increased red meat consumption. However, there exists conflicting data from a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875189?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> that showed no association. Red meat is also thought to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330594/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise estrogen and inflammation</a> which contributes to endometriosis growth. Many specialists recommend a mainly plant based diet. If consuming red meat, <a href="http://obgyn.slu.edu/uploads/centerforendo/Combined%20Anti-Inflammatory%20and%20Elimination%20Diet%20for%20Adults%20Living%20with%20Endometriosis%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">organic, grass fed beef</a> is recommended in small amounts.

<blockquote>Diets deficient in nutrients result in changes in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and promote epigenetic abnormalities, that may be involved in the genesis and progression of the disease. Foods rich in omega 3 with anti-inflammatory effects, supplementation with N-acetylcysteine, vitamin D and resveratrol, in addition to the increased consumption of fruits, vegetables (preferably organic) and whole grains exert a protective effect, reducing the risk of development and possible regression of disease. Dietary re-education seems to be a promising tool in the prevention and treatment of endometriosis.

<h3>Phytoestrogens and Xenoestrogens</h3>

Estrogen is thought to contribute to disease progression in endometriosis. Estrogen stimulates endometriosis growth so some researchers suggest reducing the consumption of foods with an estrogenic effect, or the ability to raise internal estrogen levels. These foods contain <a href="https://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483(13)00007-2/fulltext#s0120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phytoestrogens</a>, which are plant derived compounds that have an estrogenic effect on the endocrine system. Examples of phytoestrogens include soy, flaxseeds, some grains, and legumes. However, this <a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2007/05000/Effect_of_Soy_Isoflavones_on_Endometriosis_.19.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that an increased consumption of soybeans was associated with a reduced risk of advanced endometriosis. Researchers theorize that phytoestrogens may actually have the ability to block the effects of estrogen rather than increase it. Due to conflicting data, more research is needed to clarify which approach is beneficial for endometriosis. 

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10866031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xenoestrogens</a> are chemicals that mimic bad estrogen. Like phytoestrogens, they may act like estrogen internally and could interfere with the actions of endogenous estrogens. Xenoestrogens are commonly found in our environment. They can be found in plastic, pesticides, parabens, commercial food products, children’s toys, and more. Since non-organic produce has high levels of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pesticides</a> organic produce has been recommended. Patients should avoid these products to reduce their exposures. Using the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental Working Group's database</a> can help you discover safer household and personal products. 

<h3>Gluten</h3>

Gluten may play a role in endometriosis symptoms and pain. Several studies have found that following a <a href="https://www.glutenfreesociety.org/gluten-and-endometriosis-is-there-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gluten-free diet</a> can lead to a reduction in symptoms and improvements in quality of life for endometriosis patients. 75 percent of the women who took part in the study reported a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decrease in painful symptoms</a> after following a gluten-free diet for 12 months. A considerable increase in physical functioning, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, and mental health was also observed in all patients. Endometriosis is known to have a variety of comorbidities and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/26/10/2896/611791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celiacs disease</a> may be one. In research, endometriosis seems to be associated with prior Celiacs Disease. Potential explanations might be shared etiological factors and inflammation from Celiacs Disease. 

<h3>Elimination Diet</h3>

Each person with endometriosis has individual needs and food triggers. The Elimination Diet protocol is considered a useful method for identifying personal food triggers and creating an individualized diet plan based on the results. This endometriosis diet guide provides details and instructions for completing the <a href="http://obgyn.slu.edu/uploads/centerforendo/Combined%20Anti-Inflammatory%20and%20Elimination%20Diet%20for%20Adults%20Living%20with%20Endometriosis%20booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elimination Diet</a>.

While further research is needed to clarify the role of diet in disease, nutritional counseling and diet change have been shown to be a <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)01944-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost effective method to reduce pain</a> and improve the quality of life of patients with endometriosis. Patients self-report significant responses to dietary choices that can either trigger or relieve their symptoms. Dietary changes were among the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6332532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most highly rated self-management strategies</a> in a survey of endometriosis patients.

<blockquote>Nutritional counseling and therapy alongside orthodox medical treatments provides a cost effective method in the reduction of pain and improvements in the quality of life of patients with endometriosis.

<h2>Physical Therapy</h2>

Specialists agree that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complementary treatments, like physical therapy,</a> may help to reduce the patient's pain from endometriosis and provide additional health benefits. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIVCGwNYAQfzW1ULc4CIEtxeN2eAVOjv/view?fbclid=IwAR0C80P8GY_oUzcNUPBERyXbL8I71LRXYSwUp6Zl3YzCfEUCype56z9c0Cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy</a> is a specialty of physical therapy that focuses on the pelvis and the surrounding affected areas. This includes working on the muscles, bones, ligaments, and fascia in the core, hips, back, legs, and pelvis. Physical therapy to address endometriosis related pain has shown promise in initial studies. In one study, participants experienced significant improvements in all domains of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.5301/JE.2012.9088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual function, including pain, desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction</a>. The specific manual therapy used is thought to deform or cause the failure of adhesive bonds. As a result, pain decreases and mobility appears to improve. Since few studies have been conducted, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 

<blockquote>Although future research is needed, this therapy, designed to increase function and reduce pain by restoring soft tissue, visceral and osseous mobility, is a non-pharmaceutical, non-surgical technique that has produced few adverse effects or complications. As such, it offers a promising alternative to physicians, clinicians, and others involved in women’s health.

The pelvic floor muscles function as a support for the pelvic organs and make up part of the urethra, rectum, and vagina. These muscles allow for sexual intercourse and the normal functioning of bladder and bowel. When the muscles are too relaxed or too tight, it is called <a href="http://centerforendo.com/the-significance-of-pelvic-floor-muscle-dysfunction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, or PFD</a>. PFD is closely associated with endometriosis, Interstitial Cystitis, and Chronic Pelvic Pain.

Chronic Pelvic Pain and Interstitial Cystitis, or painful bladder syndrome, are common comorbidities of endometriosis. Studies on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18304280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pelvic floor physical therapy</a> for these two conditions have shown promise. Pelvic floor physical therapy addresses musculoskeletal components that are involved in pelvic and genital pain syndromes and sexual dysfunction. Physical therapy treatments include manual therapy, electrical stimulation modalities, self care education, stress management, and biofeedback. 

<h3>To Kegel or Not?</h3>

 While <a href="http://centerforendo.com/the-significance-of-pelvic-floor-muscle-dysfunction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kegel exercises</a> are commonly suggested for strengthening the pelvic floor, they may not be suitable for patients with PFD. During a kegel, the pelvic floor muscles are contracted. In PFD, the pelvic floor muscles may be hypertonic, or too tense, so this would not be appropriate. The most suitable exercises for your particular case are decided after you have been thoroughly evaluated by a physical therapist.

<blockquote>Physical therapy treatment of pelvic pain is an integral component of the multidisciplinary approach to Chronic Pelvic Pain and associated sexual dysfunction.

<h2>Acupuncture</h2>

There has been limited research on the efficacy of acupuncture for treating endometriosis related pain. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current literature</a> suggests that acupuncture has the ability to reduce pain and serum CA-125 levels. Higher levels of CA-125 levels have been reported in more advanced degrees of endometriosis. 

A systemic review found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acupuncture</a> can alleviate the pain of dysmenorrhoea and reduce peripheral blood CA-125. As a result, the therapy could be applied as a complementary treatment for endometriosis-related pain. However due to the limitations of the original studies, additional studies are needed to confirms these findings. 

<blockquote>Acupuncture may serve as a complement or alternative to these treatments. The pain-alleviating effects of acupuncture have been attributed to various physiological and psychological processes, such as activation of endogenous descending pain inhibitory systems, deactivation of brain areas that transmit pain-related signals, interaction between nociceptive impulses and somato-visceral reflexes, and the expectation of symptom relief.

Participants of the study reported a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greater knowledge of self, autonomy, and self care</a>. They also reported it was beneficial to control pelvic pain and, in turn, they reduced their use of pain and psychiatric medications.

<h2>Integrative and Holistic Medicine</h2>

<a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/integrative-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrative medicine</a> is another form of a complementary therapy that may help treat endometriosis and benefit patients. Integrative medicine is defined as a practice of medicine that is holistic in its approach. Holistic means the doctor considers the whole person, including their physical, mental, emotional, and social health when evaluating and treating the patient. Integrative medicine uses both <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conventional and complementary approaches</a> together to provide a patient focused plan. This application of medicine uses a comprehensive approach to disease management, which can benefit an endometriosis patient. 

Another holistic approach to medicine is <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/naturopathy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">naturopathic medicine</a>. Naturopathy uses conventional and alternative treatments, such as herbs, homeopathy and lifestyle changes. There are many recorded naturopathic treatments for endometriosis including <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/acm.2018.0305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herbal medicine, mineral medicine, and clinical nutrition</a>. These therapies need to be studied further to determine their efficacy. Herbs and spices that have been shown promise in treating endometriosis symptoms include <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/herbs-for-endometriosis#herbal-remedies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curcumin, chamomile, peppermint, lavender, and ginger</a>. These plants work in various ways to reduce inflammation, pain, menstrual cramps, and estradiol. 

<blockquote>Many patients choose to try complementary therapies for health benefits. Often, patients may be skeptical of conventional medical or surgical therapies and would rather try, as sole interventions or in combination with more conventional treatments, options such as acupuncture, nutrition and mind-body programs. These interventions, which are included in our program, and are targeted at decreasing inflammation, may reduce pain or make conventional therapies more tolerable. Many patients find that these options improve their pain and quality of life. In our program, integrative medicine has received the largest proportion of our referrals at 43%.

<h2>Chinese Medicine</h2>

Chinese medicine is another example of a complementary therapy that may be beneficial as a treatment for endometriosis related symptoms. Clinical studies suggest that Chinese herbs can relieve pain symptoms related to endometriosis. The mechanisms at work may include the inhibition of growth of ectopic endometrium, endocrine regulation, and the regulation of prostaglandin-related receptors. Chinese medicine might also work by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191968/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improving blood circulation and regulating immune function</a>. Further research is needed to know the efficacy and safety of these methods. 

One of the primary mechanisms involved in endometriosis is angiogenesis, or the process by which new blood vessels are formed. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191968/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angiogenesis inhibitors</a> have been shown to stop the regression of endometriosis lesions. Chinese herbs show anti-angiogenic effects. Research suggests there may be a therapeutic potential to agents derived from natural compounds and Chinese medicines. Due to the limited amount of research, more studies are needed.

In studies, certain Chinese therapies were not entirely curative of endometriosis and could not eradicate endometriosis lesions. It’s thought that these therapies may be beneficial in modulating the progress of endometriosis by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3950373/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suppressing symptoms, shrinking the lesions, and decreasing the recurrence rate</a>. 

<blockquote>Additionally, various studies verified that constituents isolated from plants, for instance, epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, puerarin, ginsenoside, and resveratrol, can be used to treat endometriosis. Hence, the use of medicinal plants and phytoconstituents of medicinal plants has been regarded as a novel approach for treating endometriosis and maintaining a healthy life. Additional long-term studies are required to support the safety of the constituents of medicinal plants, chiefly concerning the plant-drug interactions and the appropriate dosage.

<h2>Meditation and Mindfulness</h2>

Practicing <a href="https://endometriosis.net/complementary-alternative-treatment/mind-body-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meditation and mindfulness</a> may have health benefits that can be useful in managing endometriosis related symptoms. 
Those with endometriosis often suffer from chronic pain and stress due to living with a chronic illness. This intense burden can lead to depression and anxiety, which can be hard to manage. Learning to manage stress and symptoms of depression can result in less distress and physical pain. In research, a positive association between coping, depression levels, type, and levels of stress and pain intensity in patients with endometriosis has been shown.
 Finding positive coping mechanisms results in a better <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28444092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adaptation to stress and less depression</a>. 
 
 Endometriosis patients who used maladaptive coping strategies to cope were found to have an increase in depression and stress. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1093/clipsy.bpg015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meditation and mindfulness</a> may be a positive coping mechanism option for patients. Mindfulness is a technique used during meditation. It is defined as focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. Meditation is a practice in which attention and awareness is trained to achieve mental clarity, emotional calm, and a stable state.

 Mindfulness meditation has been shown to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27658913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve pain and quality of life</a>, as well as, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19045976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce depression and anxiety</a>. Meditation may positively affect the immune system in various ways including
 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26799456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meditation on specific markers of inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, and biological aging</a> but these are only tentative findings. 

<blockquote>It has been suggested that in the same way that the cerebellum regulates the rate, force, rhythm, and accuracy of movements, it also regulates the speed, capacity, consistency, and appropriateness of cognitive and emotional processes, i.e., it modulates behavior automatically around a homeostatic baseline. Given the importance that the regulation of emotions and cognition play in healthy psychological functioning, the morphological changes in these regions might contribute to the positive effects of mindfulness meditation on the salutary changes in well-being.

<cite><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004979/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- Mindfulness Practice Leads to Increases in Regional Brain Gray Matter Density</a></cite>

</blockquote>

Meditation techniques have been shown to increase gray matter density in several areas of the brain which can help <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004979/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regulate emotions and aid in learning and problem solving</a>. The hippocampus is one of these areas positively affected, which may improve function in regulating emotional responses. Other areas of the brain include the posterior cingulate cortex, the left temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum. The cerebellum is known to play a role in the regulation of emotion and cognition. It’s thought that the morphological changes to these brain regions may contribute to the benefits of mindfulness meditation. Being equipped with a better ability to emotionally and cognitively process your experience can help in disease management, stress reduction, and less physical pain.

<blockquote>Nevertheless,  endometriosis is certainly ‘not in your head’ – though a number of sources have indicated over the years that endometriosis is caused by 'negative emotions' and various deep-seated psychological components. While there are various social, psychological, and emotional aspects to any painful, chronic illness such as endometriosis, these are consequences of the disease, not the cause. The highly offensive contention that endometriosis is a psychological ailment due to one’s internal failings or otherwise rooted in emotions leads only to further delayed diagnosis and ineffective treatment of the disease, and should be denounced wherever such claims appear.

</blockquote>

Due to prevalent misinformation, social stigma, and gender bias, endometriosis related symptoms have been incorrectly labeled as hysteria or  as having a psychosomatic origin. Again and again, these antiquated notions are disproven by studies that show the various and complex molecular mechanisms involved in endometriosis. Social, psychological, and emotional changes are seen in those with endometriosis but these are a result of, not the cause of the disease. Such claims are dangerous for patients and can further delay diagnosis and result in ineffective treatment. Combining meditation and mindfulness with medical treatment may address these cognitive and emotional aspects of the disease.

<h2>Cannabis</h2>

<blockquote>The use of self-management strategies, especially non-pharmacological practices, in chronic illnesses is common. Patients with endometriosis often feel frustrated at the lack of effective medical treatments and therefore turn to self-management as one of the coping strategies to manage their condition. Patients with endometriosis often feel disempowered, and self-management strategies may help them feel a sense of agency and empowerment.

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25769875?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self management techniques</a> are commonly used by endometriosis patients and they can play a key role in endometriosis care. Self management can be self-care and lifestyle choices that mitigate symptoms, reduce stress and pain, manage side effects from medications, or treat endometriosis. A popular self management strategy is <a href="https://bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-019-2431-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannabis</a>.</p>

Cannabis is a flowering plant that is harvested for various uses including potential medicinal applications. Parts of the cannabis plant have psychoactive, or mind altering properties. This includes the flowers which are also known as marijiuna. Derivatives of the cannabis plant are hemp and CBD oil, which do not have psychoactive properties. 

Patients with endometriosis self report that cannabis use is an important and beneficial treatment. Cannabis was the <a href="https://www.jogc.com/article/S1701-2163(19)30808-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> most highly rated in terms of effectiveness in pain reduction</a> of all the strategies assessed. Cannabis was also reported to result in the greatest reduction in medication usage. Due to the pain reduction, 56% of patients reported that they were able to reduce their pharmaceutical medication by at least half. An additional 27% of patients were able to reduce medications usage by 25-50%. 

The greatest improvements from cannabis were reported in sleep and nausea and vomiting. Few adverse effects were reported and the ones reported were minor. Side effects were reported by one in ten cannabis users, which included anxiety, drowsiness, and fast heart rate.

<blockquote>When patients were asked about the effect self-management had on their need for medications needed to manage their endometriosis symptoms, the most effective was cannabis. Fifty six percent of cannabis users reported being able to reduce their endometriosis related medication by more than 50% and another 27% percent of users reported being able to reduce medication by 25–50%.

</blockquote>


Hemp and CBD Oil were also rated highly in terms of effectiveness in pain reduction. A third of CBD or hemp oil users reported being able to reduce their endometriosis related medication by 50% or more. This survey highlights the potential efficacy but further clinical research is needed to determine the effectiveness of cannabis in managing endometriosis symptoms.

A recent <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/e-cis011420.php?fbclid=IwAR1JYiwlEmGjtriKU2vnxrNF1Htofqz2chZRxs-vE-ghnO9AP9BRTKfuxKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that THC, the main psychoactive compound of cannabis, limits the development and symptoms of endometriosis in an experimental model. They also found that THC may have a protective effect on the memory of those with endometriosis. It highlights the interest of conducting further research to ensure the safety and beneficial effects of this treatment. 

<h3>The Endocannabinoid System</h3>

<a href="https://theconversation.com/1-in-10-women-with-endometriosis-report-using-cannabis-to-ease-their-pain-126516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The endocannabinoid system</a> is responsible for mediating the psychoactive effects of cannabis as well as many physiological processes, including pain sensation. The endocannabinoid system is a regulatory system that includes cannabinoid receptors, ligands, and enzymes which are located throughout the body. They are the most prevalent in the immune system, central nervous system, and the female reproductive system. 

The endocannabinoid system interacts with mechanisms that play <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436335/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an important role in endometriosis-associated pain</a> and in the establishment of the disease, its maintenance, and recurrence. It also contributes to mechanisms underlying the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2972363/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peripheral innervation of the abnormal growths</a>. Studies suggest that approaches targeted at the endocannabinoid system may serve as a promising new method for treating endometriosis related pain. 

<blockquote>The endocannabinoid system has emerged recently as an important factor in endometriosis development, maintenance, and pain mechanisms. These new revelations suggest that the endocannabinoid system may potentially serve as a pharmacological target for endometriosis treatments, including pain management, and have a role in immune intervention and antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects.

<cite><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436335/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- The Clinical Significance of Endocannabinoids in Endometriosis Pain Management</a></cite>

</blockquote>

Several studies have described endometriosis as an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15159679/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endocannabinoid deficiency condition</a>. The growth of endometriosis tissue and more severe pain are potentially related to reduced endocannabinoid function. Patients with endometriosis have been found to have lower levels of certain endocannabinoid receptors in their endometrial tissue.

Various interactions between the endocannabinoid system and pain associated mechanisms in endometriosis patients occur. These include involvement of neuropathic and inflammatory pain, changes in central and peripheral neural system, and the expression of cannabinoid receptors. Modulating the endocannabinoid system appears to be a beneficial therapy for addressing these various components and reducing pain. Cannabis may relieve endometriosis related pain by interacting with the endocannabinoid system with its chemicals, including <a href="http://theconversation.com/1-in-10-women-with-endometriosis-report-using-cannabis-to-ease-their-pain-126516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)</a>. More studies are needed to further our knowledge on the endocannabiniod system and to learn more about the potential side effects of cannabis for endometriosis treatment.
