<h2>Acupuncture</h2>

There has been limited research on the efficacy of acupuncture for treating endometriosis-related pain. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18794019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current literature</a> suggests that acupuncture has the ability to reduce pain and serum CA-125 levels. Higher levels of CA-125 have been reported in more advanced stages of endometriosis. 

A systemic review found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acupuncture</a> can alleviate the pain of dysmenorrhoea and reduce peripheral blood CA-125. As a result, the therapy could be applied as a complementary treatment for endometriosis-related pain. Due to limitations of the original studies, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings. 

<blockquote>Acupuncture may serve as a complement or alternative to these treatments. The pain-alleviating effects of acupuncture have been attributed to various physiological and psychological processes, such as activation of endogenous descending pain inhibitory systems, deactivation of brain areas that transmit pain-related signals, interaction between nociceptive impulses and somato-visceral reflexes, and the expectation of symptom relief.

Patients have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6332532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-reported</a> using complementary and alternative therapies, like acupuncture, as an important part of their self-management techniques.
