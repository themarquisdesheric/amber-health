<h2>Integrative and Holistic Medicine</h2>

<a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/integrative-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrative medicine</a> is another complementary therapy that may help treat endometriosis and benefit patients. Integrative medicine is defined as a practice of medicine that is holistic in its approach. Holistic means the doctor considers the whole person, including their physical, mental, emotional, and social health when evaluating and treating the patient. Integrative medicine uses both <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661982/?fbclid=IwAR1ytZua-OpiBsknNROSa0ucyF3dB5ExX2IIDSFEAeFsPdru1SXW22mHZKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conventional and complementary approaches</a> together to provide a patient-focused plan. This application of medicine uses a comprehensive approach to disease management, which can benefit an endometriosis patient. 

Another holistic approach to medicine is <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/naturopathy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">naturopathic medicine</a>. Naturopathy uses conventional and alternative treatments, such as herbs, homeopathy and lifestyle changes. There are many recorded naturopathic treatments for endometriosis including <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/acm.2018.0305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herbal medicine, mineral medicine, and clinical nutrition</a>. These therapies need to be studied further to determine their efficacy. Herbs and spices that have been shown promise in treating endometriosis symptoms include <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/herbs-for-endometriosis#herbal-remedies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curcumin, chamomile, peppermint, lavender, and ginger</a>. These plants work in various ways to reduce inflammation, pain, menstrual cramps, and estradiol. 

<blockquote>Many patients choose to try complementary therapies for health benefits. Often, patients may be skeptical of conventional medical or surgical therapies and would rather try, as sole interventions or in combination with more conventional treatments, options such as acupuncture, nutrition and mind-body programs. These interventions, which are included in our program, and are targeted at decreasing inflammation, may reduce pain or make conventional therapies more tolerable. Many patients find that these options improve their pain and quality of life. In our program, integrative medicine has received the largest proportion of our referrals at 43%.
