<h2>Learn More</h2>

This collection of books covers an array of topics on endometriosis, including diet and nutrition, surgery, disease management, holistic treatment options, and much more. The titles have been arranged according to their main focus but often there is an overlap in subjects. Reviews have been given for the ones that I have read. I've included titles that I have not read but have received good reviews from doctors and patients. Of course, there are many excellent books for endometriosis that may not be listed. Unfortunately, many of these titles do not use inclusive language. When possible, read as many as you can to expand your understanding of this complex condition. You can use your local library to access many of these titles for free. 

<h3>Endometriosis 101</h3>

Since it is written by an excision specialist, the descriptions and details on surgery are very informative. It’s important to understand the benefits and risks of the available surgical approaches. I would recommend this book to anyone considering surgery.

I would highly recommend this book. Since most doctors are not well versed in diet and nutritional therapy, I found this book essential in understanding the connection between disease and diet. It details the science behind the methods and provides an in depth look at endometriosis. I felt empowered by learning these tools for self care.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endometriosis-Health-Diet-Program-Your/dp/077880562X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Endometriosis Health and Diet Program: Get Your Life Back</a> by Andrew Cook, MD and Danielle Cook, MS, RD, CDE - This will dispel the myths surrounding endometriosis and provide scientifically based recommendations that are easy to understand and follow.

<h3>Gender and Racial Bias in Medicine</h3>

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Harm-Medicine-Dismissed-Misdiagnosed/dp/0062470809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick</a> by Maya Dusenbery - An eye opening read for patients and health care providers alike, this shows how women suffer because the medical community knows relatively less about their diseases and bodies and too often doesn’t trust their reports of their symptoms. Offering a clear explanation of the root causes of this insidious and entrenched bias and laying out its sometimes catastrophic consequences, this is a rallying wake up call that will change the way we look at health care for women. I would highly recommend! This is one of my top recommendations. This was as riveting as it was harrowing. The substantial evidence of medical neglect, abuse, and bias is truly maddening.

They are also one of the most ignored groups in our medical system, a system where young women, especially women of color and trans women, are invisible. I would highly recommend. This is one of my top recommendations. This balances the autobiography of a chronically ill person with a historical look at medical abuse and neglect. While this doesn't focus on endometriosis specifically, this is a favorite of mine and it's extremely relevant.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sick-Memoir-Porochista-Khakpour/dp/006242873X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sick: A Memoir</a> by Porochista Khakpour - This is a grueling, emotional journey as a woman, an Iranian-American, a writer, and a lifelong sufferer of undiagnosed health problems, in which she examines her subsequent struggles with late stage Lyme disease, mental illness, and her addiction to doctor prescribed medications.
