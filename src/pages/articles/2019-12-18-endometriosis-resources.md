Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read the **article** [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This Part of my series on Endometriosis. (**tag to TOC**)

<h2>Resources for Endometriosis</h2>

These are trusted informational resources that explain the disease, possible causes, diagnostic methods, and treatment options available for endometriosis. Most of these sites are dedicated to disease awareness, furthering research, empowering patients, and promoting advocacy. Many of these resources are cited or listed throughout the series. Unfortunately, some of these sources do not use inclusive language and rely on gendered language when discussing the disease. This is not an exhaustive list of websites, specialists, or articles on endometriosis.

<h3>Finding a Specialist</h3> 

Though endometriosis is a common condition affecting 176 billion people worldwide, there are very few specialists in the medical community. It's estimated that there are <a href="https://www.endofound.org/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-an-endometriosis-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less than 200 excision surgeons</a> in practice worldwide. What a stark lack of medical support for an epidemic scaled disease. Finding a knowledgeable and compassionate provider can be one of the hardest aspects of managing this disease. Without proper medical support, the symptoms can become chronic comorbidities that will need their own medical intervention. Here are some tools for finding a specialist provider near you.

<h3>For Support</h3>

Finding adequate support, receiving validation, and maintaining one's self worth and dignity are all important components of disease management and basic human rights. Below are some online communities to join for support and advice. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The internet community created by these forums provides a lifeline through the four to ten years it often takes to receive a diagnosis of endometriosis—and for the years of no known cure afterwards. While WebMD and the abundance of resources out there that serve as tools for self-diagnosis can at times do more harm than good, supportive communities like those Furseth and Norman describe can be crucial outlets for needs that aren’t being met by the medical establishment, needs that are overwhelmingly felt by women—especially women of color, whose pain consistently goes unrecognized and untreated by doctors. These forums and the homespun cures they prescribe will and should continue until health professionals recognize their failings and acknowledge that sometimes, the patient may actually know her own body better than the practitioner.

<h3>Inclusive Care: Trans and Non-binary Patients</h3>
 
 <blockquote class="blockquote">It is also imperative to look beyond gendered health and include all persons, many of whom who are  often struggling to access endometriosis diagnosis, treatment and supportive, quality care in a traditionally female-identified space. The oft-overlooked, unique considerations in healthcare settings that fail to be inclusive can lead to additional stressors, further isolation and impaired treatments. Without a doubt: endometriosis has a significant social and psychological impact on the diverse population affected – across several domains of their lives. The time for the disease to receive recognition as a major public health issue is long past due.
