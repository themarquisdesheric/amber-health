<h3>Finding a Specialist</h3> 

Though endometriosis is a common condition affecting over 176 million people worldwide, there are very few specialists in the medical community that can provide support. It's estimated that there are <a href="https://www.endofound.org/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-an-endometriosis-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as few as 100 excision surgeons</a> in practice worldwide. What a stark lack of medical support for an epidemic scaled disease. Finding a knowledgeable and compassionate provider can be one of the hardest aspects of managing the disease. Without proper medical support, the symptoms can become chronic comorbidities that will need their own medical intervention. Knowing how to communicate with your doctors and how to gauge their expertise in endometriosis care are important skills to learn. Several communication and screening techniques are offered below, as well as, tools for finding an endometriosis specialist near you.

<h3>Hormonal Medications and Hormonal Health</h3>

Many doctors use hormonal medications as a first line treatment for endometriosis. Hormone medication can come in the form of oral contraceptives, or birth control pills, progestin only pills, progestin medicines, and GnRH agonists. While hormonal medications are the most commonly prescribed drugs for endometriosis, they have been shown to <a href="http://endopaedia.info/diagnosis12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not eradicate</a>, <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop progression</a>, or <a href="https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/endometriosis/case-surgery-endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve the disease long term</a>.

<h3>For Adolescents and Teens</h3>

The adolescent population is <a href="https://endometriosis.org/resources/articles/teenagers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commonly affected by endometriosis</a> and experience an early onset of symptoms. This makes sense when you consider the hormonal changes taking place at this transitional time. During the developmental stages of teenage years, hormones begin to fluctuate and the body starts producing estrogen. This change in hormones can initiate the pain and symptoms of endometriosis. Endometriosis lesions have been found to occur in patients both <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3712662/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before menstruation and early after it</a>.

<blockquote class="blockquote">In addition, when endometriosis appears during adolescence, there is likelihood that the disease will progress and, if left untreated, produce adverse effects that go beyond pain, and include infertility. Finally, a majority of adolescent girls with chronic pelvic pain not responding to conventional medical therapy have endometriosis. For all these reasons, an early identification of the disease may go a long way in slowing or preventing progression.

<h3>Support Groups</h3>

Finding adequate support, receiving validation, and maintaining one's self worth and dignity are all important components of disease management and basic human rights. Below are some online communities to join for support, advice, and disease information. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">The internet community created by these forums provides a lifeline through the four to ten years it often takes to receive a diagnosis of endometriosis and for the years of no known cure afterwards. While WebMD and the abundance of resources out there that serve as tools for self-diagnosis can at times do more harm than good, supportive communities like those Furseth and Norman describe can be crucial outlets for needs that aren’t being met by the medical establishment, needs that are overwhelmingly felt by women, especially women of color, whose pain consistently goes unrecognized and untreated by doctors. These forums and the homespun cures they prescribe will and should continue until health professionals recognize their failings and acknowledge that sometimes, the patient may actually know her own body better than the practitioner.

<h3>Inclusive Care: Trans and Non-binary Patients</h3>

<a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inclusion</a> in endometriosis care is even more stark. Gendered language surrounds the discussion of endometriosis. Anyone with a uterus, regardless of identity, can have the disease. This includes individuals who menstruate and those who do not. Incorrectly, trans men and non-binary individuals are excluded from a majority of medical texts, research, and awareness. This leads to an even longer delay in diagnosis or a complete exclusion from appropriate care. The resulting isolation, stress, and burden are profound. 
 
 <blockquote class="blockquote">It is also imperative to look beyond gendered health and include all persons, many of whom who are  often struggling to access endometriosis diagnosis, treatment and supportive, quality care in a traditionally female-identified space. The oft-overlooked, unique considerations in healthcare settings that fail to be inclusive can lead to additional stressors, further isolation and impaired treatments. Without a doubt: endometriosis has a significant social and psychological impact on the diverse population affected – across several domains of their lives. The time for the disease to receive recognition as a major public health issue is long past due.

<h3>Gender Bias in Medicine</h3>

<h3>Featured In The Media</h3>

As our understanding of endometriosis continues to grow, more awareness is being raised through publications, articles, and blogs. The more awareness that society has, the more research and funding can be dedicated to endometriosis. Patients' personal stories can be informative and validating. These are great for sharing on social media or with friends and family to educate them and to bring awareness to endometriosis.

<h3>At Work</h3>

The burden of cost is two fold for an endometriosis patient: the cost of medical treatments and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cost of lost productivity</a>. 
The available literature and data suggest that endometriosis impairs <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health related quality of life and work productivity</a> and is a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17056043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">considerable burden</a> on patients.
