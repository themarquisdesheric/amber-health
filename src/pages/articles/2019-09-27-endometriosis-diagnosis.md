Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article [Endometriosis 101](/articles/2019-08-21-endometriosis/).

This Part of my series on Endometriosis. (**tag to TOC**)

<h2>How is it Diagnosed?</h2>

Currently there is only <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one method</a> that can confirm a diagnosis of endometriosis. This is via surgery with confirmation of biopsy specimens. 

While symptoms, patient history, and physical findings can lead to a strong suspicion in identifying the disease, surgical diagnosis must be confirmed. <a href="http://endopaedia.info/diagnosis12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laparoscopy</a> is currently the most common method of surgical diagnosis.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>The only way to confirm a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is still surgically; usually via the minimally invasive procedure known as Laparoscopy.

</blockquote>

Due to prevailing misinformation, healthcare providers are often not knowledgeable about which procedure is definitive in diagnosing endometriosis. In turn, many patients will undergo several types of testing in the process of diagnosing endometriosis.  It is important to understand the <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">limitations</a> of these methods as you seek care.

<h3>Surgery + Biopsy Specimens</h3>

Surgery with confirmation of biopsy specimens is the <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only definitive diagnostic tool</a> for confirming endometriosis! Laparoscopy surgery is the most common diagnostic surgery and is also considered the gold standard of treatment for the disease.

<h3>Lab Testing</h3>

Lab testing <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot be used</a>  to test for endometriosis. For example, a patient cannot have their blood, urine, or saliva tested to confirm the disease. There are currently <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no known diagnostic biomarkers</a> that can be used to diagnose endometriosis. While there have been over 50 biomarkers studied, none have had universal success. There is continued interest in this field with recent research emerging on possible markers including <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)</a>  and concurrent measurements of CA125, syntaxin-5 and laminin-1. Further studies are needed to know if these are useful markers in diagnosing endometriosis. 

<h3>Imaging Testing</h3>

Imaging testing can be helpful a tool but it <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot be used for diagnosis</a>. Imaging testing includes computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasounds. While diagnostic testing can be helpful for presurgical planning, they do not provide clear evidence of endometriosis and cannot be used to confirm the disease. Due to misinformed healthcare providers, it is common to have a pelvic ultrasound and MRI before undergoing laparoscopic surgery. 

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Though symptoms and/or diagnostic testing may give rise to 'informed suspicion' and are helpful for presurgical planning, only surgery permits the requisite visual and histological (biopsy proven) diagnosis. Most importantly, Laparoscopy also facilitates actual treatment of the disease.

<h3>Clinical Diagnosis</h3>

There has been an increased interest in accepting and treating a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis that relies on patient history and symptoms. This diagnosis would <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not be proven with surgery</a>. While patients would benefit from an easier and earlier diagnostic method, undergoing medical treatment without a definitive diagnosis has its own clear dangers and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17070183?dopt=AbstractPlus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">limitations</a>. 

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>It is inappropriate  and impossible  to diagnose endometriosis medically.

</blockquote>

Unfortunately, big pharma has aligned itself with this movement to promote the use of ineffective hormonal therapy as "treatment". There are proven limitations and risks to using hormonal suppression which will be discussed in 
[Endometriosis Treatments](/articles/2019-09-28-endometriosis-treatment/).
Foregoing a diagnosis and relying on an ineffective medical option is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17070183?dopt=AbstractPlus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not advised</a> for successful disease management.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Although recent guidelines for the management of chronic pelvic pain suggest that diagnostic laparoscopy may be considered a secondary investigation after the failure of therapeutic interventions, the present study highlights the importance of an early diagnosis for patients who suffer from physical, emotional, and social levels when they remain undiagnosed.

<h3>Delays in Diagnosis</h3>

Despite the staggering prevalence of endometriosis and the early onset of symptoms for many, it takes an average of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8671344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 years</a> for a patient to receive an accurate diagnosis in the United states. A recent study found that there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17070183?dopt=AbstractPlus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four key factors</a> that contribute to the lengthy delay in diagnosis.

The lack of knowledge among patients and medical providers is largely to blame. The stigma surrounding menstruation, women’s health issues, and <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marginalized communities</a> including trans and non-binary individuals keep the many afflicted silent, isolated, and medically neglected. Ableism promotes a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17070183?dopt=AbstractPlus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">normalization of symptoms and pain</a> in society and leads to further dismissal from the medical community.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>

Only through early intervention can we reduce the associated morbidity, infertility and progressive symptoms of endometriosis.  We must alleviate our culture of menstrual misinformation through timely and authoritative disease education – thus leading to reduced costs and most importantly, improved patient outcome.  Early diagnosis and proper treatment are critical keys to living well in spite of the disease.

</blockquote>

Additional factors that contribute to the delay include symptom suppression through hormones and nondiscriminatory investigation methods. While the use of hormonal suppression can provide symptom relief, the <a href="https://www.jmig.org/article/S1553-4650(16)30047-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disease will continue to progress</a> and require additional treatments, especially once suppression has been stopped. <a href="https://endometriosis.org/news/research/why-the-diagnostic-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inadequate diagnostic methods</a> that can not properly identify endometriosis are indiscriminately used. In turn, patients are given inaccurate results, are further dismissed by their doctors, and remain medically neglected.

<h3>Importance of Diagnosis</h3>

Endometriosis patients on average see <a href="https://swhr.org/experts-identify-challenges-in-endometriosis-research-and-patient-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 7 doctors</a>, are often misdiagnosed multiple times, and receive unnecessary and inappropriate treatments including irreversible surgical procedures. 

Studies have shown that **endometriosis symptoms (add)** have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15154905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">substantial impact on quality of life</a> including the physical, emotional, and social wellbeing of patients. Symptoms are reported to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2860000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disrupt all aspects of a patient’s daily</a> lives and are characterized by physical limitations that significantly disrupt health and work performance.

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Despite the existence of severe pain, often described as 'intense' or 'overwhelming', patients experienced a delay in receiving a diagnosis of endometriosis, and their symptoms were frequently trivialized or normalized. This, and the limited effectiveness of treatments, affected relationships with partners and family, work, and sexual relations, although individual experiences in each area were diverse.

The medical neglect and abuse of endometriosis patients must stop. As with any disease, it is imperative to receive an early and accurate diagnosis which leads to the appropriate treatment approach and better quality of life. 

<blockquote class=”blockquote”>Patients benefited from a diagnosis, because it provided a language in which to discuss their condition, offered possible management strategies to control symptoms, and provided reassurance that symptoms were not due to cancer. Diagnosis also sanctioned patient’s access to social support and legitimized absences from social and work obligations.
