Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to your health. Being truly informed about endometriosis and its treatment options is the only way to receive adequate medical care and successfully manage your health. Unfortunately, endometriosis has long been shrouded in myths, medical dogma, gender bias, and misinformation. This site is dedicated to bringing up to date, accurate information and resources to patients and their caregivers.

For an introduction to endometriosis please read my article Endometriosis 101. **Tag**

This Part of my series on Endometriosis. (**tag to TOC**)

<h3>How is it Diagnosed?</h3>

Currently there is only <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one method</a> that can confirm a diagnosis of endometriosis. This is via surgery with confirmation of biopsy specimens. 

While symptoms, patient history, and physical findings can lead to a strong suspicion in identifying the disease, surgical diagnosis must be confirmed. <a href="http://endopaedia.info/diagnosis12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laparoscopy</a> is currently the most common method of surgical diagnosis.

Due to prevailing misinformation, healthcare providers are often not knowledgeable about which procedure is definitive in diagnosing endometriosis. In turn, many patients will undergo several types of testing in the process of diagnosing endometriosis.  It is important to understand the <a href="https://www.endofound.org/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">limitations</a> of these methods as you seek care.

<h3>Laparoscopy + Biopsy Specimens</h3>

This the only <a href="http://centerforendo.com/endometriosis-understanding-a-complex-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">definitive diagnostic tool</a> for confirming endometriosis! Laparoscopy is also considered the gold standard of treatment for the disease.

<h3>Lab Testing</h3>

Lab testing cannot be used to test for endometriosis. For example, a patient cannot have their blood, urine, or saliva tested to confirm the disease. 

Endo found 

There are currently no known diagnostic biomarkers

 that can be used to diagnose endometriosis. While there have been over 50 biomarkers studied, none have had universal success. There is continued interest in this field with recent research emerging on possible markers including anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)

(endofound) 

and concurrent measurements of CA125, syntaxin-5 and laminin-1. Further studies are needed to know if these are useful markers in diagnosing endometriosis.
