Goin' back to the place
Where it all started from
Gonna see my old friends try and have a little fun
Goin' back to the way that it once used to be
Have a couple drinks and wander aimlessly
Just like old times
Yeah just like old times
And maybe see the changes in me
Remember where I've been and never go back again
Maybe see the changes in me
Make no mistake
There's plenty of those to make
Never never never goin' back
Never ever ever goin' back
Goin' back to the place where my lover and I met
I can give her all I got
She can wring my little neck just like old times
Just like old times
Goin' back to the time when I didn't need a thing
Just the tappin' of my foot and a little song to sing
That'll do just fine
Yeah that'll do just fine
And maybe?
Tell me where I go, tell me where I come
Take me anytime you like hon'
Take me as I am or as who I might become
