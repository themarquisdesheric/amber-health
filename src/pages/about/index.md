title: Bio/My Story
---
I think I’ve avoided this moment, this great reveal, because I had thought that if given more time, I wouldn't even need it. I could just gloss over the last few decades of disease to one big hooray, I’m cured. The influence of an ableist world made me feel that I could only open the door to my illness, if it wasn’t my reality anymore. Due to the perfect orchestration of genetics, environmental triggers, and several serious infections, I’ve developed a seemingly endless list of health conditions that are unrelenting and significantly disabling. This kept me quiet for many years when I had so much to share. I was brimming over with information and experiences, but all dealing with the raw reality of illness. I was wrong to assume my experience wasn’t valid and my silence was most valuable. Silence doesn’t criticize, question, and demand change. Agency requires a voice. The injustices and abuses I faced are not deserving of my own shame, but are the failings of larger systems at play that I now feel responsible to speak upon. I was burning with the fury of a thousand suns. The fury of seeing, experiencing, and learning of the injustices and neglect in the medical community. I didn’t want to burn up. Instead I harnessed that energy for a constructive pursuit. One to match empowerment to destruction. One to match healing to the current harm. 

Society only desires a sickspiration story with a happy ending and clear resolution but that isn’t my truth, at least for now. I gave up my profound healer story for a life that pivots to meet the realities. I can decide my fate. I cannot change the rare body type I have or the genetic and traumatic factors that created it but I can learn to utilize all available modalities to further my range abilities. Some things will remain only a fantasy and others are luckily more malleable. As I am able to separate myself from the diagnoses and medical neglect, I began working with the leftover strings and began braiding a new design. It will be vibrant, and it will be as illustrious as the original plan, but it will simply not be as before.
